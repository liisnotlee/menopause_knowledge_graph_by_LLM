After menopause, a woman cannot become pregnant, except in rare cases when specialized fertility treatments are used. Most women experience menopause between the ages of 45 and 55 years as a natural part of biological ageing. Menopause can also be a consequence of surgical or medical procedures. Menopause is caused by the loss of ovarian follicular function and a decline in circulating blood oestrogen levels. The menopausal transition can be gradual, usually beginning with changes in the menstrual cycle. Perimenopause refers to the period from when these signs are first observed and ends one year after the final menstrual period. Perimenopause can last several years and can affect physical, emotional, mental and social well-being. A variety of non-hormonal and hormonal interventions can help alleviate perimenopausal symptoms. Overview For most women, menopause is marked by the end of monthly menstruation (also known as a menstrual period or ‘period’) due to loss of ovarian follicular function. This means that the ovaries stop releasing eggs for fertilization. The regularity and length of the menstrual cycle varies across a woman’s reproductive life span, but the age at which natural menopause occurs is generally between 45 and 55 years for women worldwide. Natural menopause is deemed to have occurred after 12 consecutive months without menstruation for which there is no other obvious physiological or pathological cause and in the absence of clinical intervention. Some women experience menopause earlier (before 40 years of age). This premature menopause may be because of certain chromosomal abnormalities, autoimmune disorders or other unknown causes. It is not possible to predict when an individual woman will experience menopause, although there are associations between the age at menopause and certain demographic, health and genetic factors. Menopause can also be induced as a consequence of surgical procedures that involve removal of both ovaries or medical interventions that cause cessation of ovarian function (for example radiation therapy or chemotherapy). Many women have already stopped menstruating before menopause, for example those who have had certain surgical procedures (hysterectomy or surgical removal of their uterine lining) as well as those using certain hormonal contraceptives and other medicines that cause infrequent or absent periods. They may still experience other changes related to the menopausal transition. Changes associated with menopause The hormonal changes associated with menopause can affect physical, emotional, mental and social well-being. The symptoms experienced during and following the menopausal transition vary substantially from person to person. Some have few if any symptoms. For others, symptoms can be severe and affect daily activities and quality of life. Some can experience symptoms for several years. Symptoms associated with menopause include: hot flushes and night sweats. Hot flushes refer to a sudden feeling of heat in the face, neck and chest, often accompanied by flushing of the skin, perspiration (sweating), palpitations and acute feelings of physical discomfort which can last several minutes; changes in the regularity and flow of the menstrual cycle, culminating in cessation of menstruation; vaginal dryness, pain during sexual intercourse and incontinence; difficulty sleeping/insomnia; and changes in mood, depression and anxiety. Body composition and cardiovascular risk can also be affected. Women’s advantage over men in terms of cardiovascular disease gradually disappears with the significant decline in oestrogen levels after menopause. Menopause can also result in the weakening of the pelvic support structures, increasing the risk of pelvic organ prolapse. Loss of bone density at menopause is a significant contributor to higher rates of osteoporosis and fractures. There are a variety of non-hormonal and hormonal interventions that can help alleviate symptoms of menopause. Symptoms that impact on health and well-being should be discussed with a health-care provider to identify available management options, with consideration of medical history, values, and preferences. Pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. Contraception is recommended to avoid unintended pregnancy until after 12 consecutive months without menstruation. Pregnancy after menopause is unlikely without fertility treatment that involves the use of donor eggs or previously frozen embryos. During perimenopause and following menopause, it is still possible to acquire sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, through unprotected sexual contact, including oral, anal and vaginal sex. The thinning of the vaginal wall after menopause increases the chances of lesions and tears, thereby increasing the risk of HIV transmission during vaginal sex. The importance of understanding menopause It is critical to see menopause as just one point in a continuum of life stages. A woman’s health status entering the perimenopausal period will largely be determined by prior health and reproductive history, lifestyle and environmental factors. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms can be disruptive to personal and professional lives, and changes associated with menopause will affect a woman’s health as she ages. Therefore, perimenopausal care plays an important role in the promotion of healthy ageing and quality of life. Menopause can be an important transition from a social perspective, as well as a biological one. Socially, a women’s experience of menopause may be influenced by gender norms, familial and sociocultural factors, including how female ageing and the menopausal transition are viewed in her culture. The global population of postmenopausal women is growing. In 2021, women aged 50 and over accounted for 26% of all women and girls globally. This was up from 22% 10 years earlier (1) . Additionally, women are living longer. Globally, a woman aged 60 years in 2019 could expect to live on average another 21 years (2) . Menopause can offer an important opportunity to reassess one’s health, lifestyle, and goals. Public health challenges related to menopause Perimenopausal women need access to quality health services and communities and systems that can support them. Unfortunately, both awareness and access to menopause-related information and services remain a significant challenge in most countries. Menopause is often not discussed within families, communities, workplaces, or health-care settings. Women may not know that symptoms they experience are related to menopause, or that there are counselling and treatment options that can help alleviate discomfort. Those experiencing menopausal symptoms may feel embarrassed or ashamed to draw attention to their experiences and ask for support. Health-care providers may not be trained to recognize perimenopausal and post-menopausal symptoms and counsel patients on treatment options and staying healthy after the menopausal transition. Menopause currently receives limited attention in the training curricula for many health-care workers. The sexual well-being of menopausal women is overlooked in many countries. This means that common gynaecological effects of menopause, including vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse, may go unaddressed. Similarly, older women may not consider themselves at risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV (3) , or may not be counselled by their providers to practice safer sex or get tested. Many governments do not have health polices and financing for the inclusion of menopause-related diagnosis, counselling, and treatment services as part of their routinely available services. Menopause-related services are a particular challenge in settings where there are often other urgent and competing priorities for health funding. WHO response WHO considers that social, psychological and physical health support during the menopausal transition and after menopause should be an integral part of health care. WHO is committed to increasing understanding of menopause by: raising awareness of menopause and its impact on women at individual and societal levels, as well as on countries’ health and socioeconomic development; advocating for the inclusion of diagnosis, treatment and counselling related to management of menopausal symptoms as part of universal health coverage; promoting the inclusion of training on menopause and treatment options in pre-service curricula for health workers; and emphasizing a life course approach to health and well-being (including sexual health and well-being), by ensuring that women have access to appropriate health information and services to promote healthy ageing and a high quality of life before, during and after menopause. Notes 1) Whilst most personal experiences with menopause relate to cisgender women (who were born female and identify as female), transgender men and some people who identify as neither men nor women also experience menopause. This fact sheet refers to “women” in alignment with the available data, which does not routinely identify gender identity. There is a paucity of readily available data on trans and gender diverse experiences of menopause.\\xa0Trans and gender diverse people have unique age-related health needs that clinicians should consider, including referral to specialist services when necessary. 2) Although menopause is not a disease, this fact sheet refers to the perimenopausal and postmenopausal experiences of women as symptoms because they can result in a level of discomfort that affects their quality of life.

The time leading up to it is called\\nperimenopause and generally lasts for several years.The levels of hormones in\\nthe body fluctuate throughout this time, which is why hot flashes are so\\ncommon during perimenopause and even beyond menopause. At ZOE, we run the\\nlargest nutrition study of its kind in the world, with over 10,000\\ncontributors to date. In our research, we have seen many differences between\\nwomen before and after menopause, including worse sleep.Take a free quiz to\\nfind out more about how the ZOE program can help you eat the best foods for\\nyour body before, during, and after menopause.Read on to learn how improving\\nyour diet might help relieve menopause symptoms. We'll also cover some\\nresearch into specific foods and how they might help. Discover your unique\\nbiologyUnderstand how your body responds to food with ZOETake the first\\nstepWhat changes in the body during menopause?During perimenopause, women\\nexperience fluctuations in levels of the reproductive hormones estrogen and\\nprogesterone. You may notice changes in your menstrual cycle or the intensity\\nof your periods.After menopause, when you haven’t had a period for 12 months,\\nestrogen settles at a lower level and your body stops producing progesterone\\ncompletely. During this process, you may experience a range of symptoms,\\nincluding:menstrual changessleep disturbancesmood changesbladder control\\nissuesvaginal drynesshot flashesweight gainproblems with memoryHot flashes and\\n“night sweats” are the most common symptoms of perimenopause, and almost 80%\\nof women experience them.During a hot flash, you may feel a sudden warmth or\\nheat spreading around your neck, face, or upper body. This can be accompanied\\nby a flushed appearance, sweating, and often anxiety.Experts don't know\\nexactly what causes or triggers hot flashes, but they suspect that changing\\nhormone levels affect the hypothalamus, which is the part of your brain that\\nregulates body temperature. Foods and diet changes that could ease hot\\nflashesHere's some good news: There’s evidence that making changes to what you\\neat can help reduce menopausal symptoms. As we’ll see below, scientists have\\nlooked at different aspects of this, but it can be broadly summed up in one\\nshort sentence: Eat more plants.PhytoestrogensPhytoestrogens are plant\\ncompounds that mimic some of the functions of estrogen. They may help to\\ncounter the reduced hormone levels that accompany menopause. There are two\\nmain types of phytoestrogens — isoflavones and lignans.Soybeans are\\nparticularly rich in isoflavones and lignans. Flaxseeds and sesame have high\\nlevels of lignans.Other plants that contain lignans include: nuts and seeds:\\ncashewswhole grains: rye, oats, wheat, spelt, buckwheat fruits: apricot,\\npears, grapes, kiwi vegetables: bell pepper, green beans, carrots, zucchini A\\nreview of 10 studies concluded that women who took phytoestrogen supplements\\nexperienced hot flashes much less often than those who didn’t. The amount of\\nphytoestrogen that the women in these studies took varied from 36 mg to 100 mg\\nper day. In comparison, 3 ounces of soft tofu contains 20 mg of isoflavones,\\nand 3 ounces of natto has 70 mg. However, not all studies have shown a strong\\neffect, so scientists are still investigating. But because foods that contain\\nisoflavones are all healthy options, there's no harm in giving them a try.A\\nplant-based dietA small study examining the effects of a low-fat, plant-based\\ndiet showed that eating more plants may help with hot flashes.The participants\\nwere all women who experienced hot flashes at least twice a day and had gone\\nthrough menopause. One group switched to a plant-based diet — including half a\\ncup per day of cooked soybeans — while the other group stuck to their normal\\ndiets.After 12 weeks, those in the plant-based group experienced significantly\\nfewer hot flashes than those in the control group, with most also reporting\\nless severe symptoms.It's important to note that this was a small study, so we\\nneed to be careful not to over-interpret the results. At the same time, we\\nknow that a plant-based diet is good for your health, so upping your plant\\nintake is a great idea whether it reduces hot flashes or not.The Mediterranean\\ndietThe Mediterranean diet is an eating pattern that is high in vegetables,\\nfruits, nuts, legumes (like lentils and chickpeas), and healthy oils like\\nolive oil. One large-scale study looked at the eating habits of 6,040 women.\\nIt identified six different patterns of eating and found that women who ate a\\nMediterranean diet or consumed lots of fruit were significantly less likely to\\nreport hot flashes and night sweats than those on the other diets.Join our\\nmailing listGet occasional updates on our latest developments and scientific\\ndiscoveries. No spam. We promise.Foods to avoidJust as eating more of certain\\nfoods may help with your hot flashes, so could limiting the amounts of some\\nother foods and drinks you consume. CoffeeThe caffeine in coffee and tea\\nnarrows your blood vessels and raises blood pressure, which may be involved in\\ntriggering hot flashes. One large-scale study showed that consuming more\\ncaffeine was linked to experiencing more hot flashes. So, cutting down on\\ncoffee could help with your symptoms.Everyone responds differently to\\ncaffeine, so it might be worth reducing your intake to see if it helps.Foods\\nhigh in fat and sugarThe same study that showed the Mediterranean diet can\\nhelp with hot flashes also found that a diet high in fat and processed sugar\\ncan do the opposite. So, if you experience hot flashes, try to limit the\\namount of sweets and cakes you eat. With ZOE, no food is off the table, but\\neating these foods just once in a while might help. Our research has found\\nthat the way women’s bodies respond to food changes. You're more likely to\\nexperience high blood sugar after meals, which can lead to weight gain during\\nmenopause and a higher risk of chronic health conditions. Spicy foodsThere’s\\nsome research to indicate that spicy foods can make hot flashes worse or\\nhappen more often. But research into this is limited. If you regularly eat hot\\nfood and have hot flashes, try milder spices to see if that helps with your\\nsymptoms. SummaryMenopause and the lead up to it can come with uncomfortable\\nsymptoms for women. But there’s good evidence that changing to your diet might\\nhelp. Experiment with plants that are rich in phytoestrogens — like soybeans,\\nflaxseeds, whole grains, and legumes — or follow the Mediterranean diet, which\\nis also rich in plants and healthy oils.Limiting foods high in processed sugar\\nand fat can help, too. And you can also try cutting down on spicy foods and\\ncaffeine, and focus on staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Although\\nthese broad changes to your diet may help with your hot flashes, at ZOE, we\\nknow that nutrition is highly personal. The ZOE at-home test analyzes your\\nbody’s responses to food and the bacteria in your gut to find the best foods\\nfor you at your current life stage.

    "Albert Einstein[a] (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics.[1][5] His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called \"the world's most famous equation\".[6] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg)[note 1] the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later, which he kept for the rest of his life, and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia.[note 1] In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews,[8] he decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940.[9] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research.\n",

    "In 1905, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers.[10] In them, he outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole.[11][12] In 1917, Einstein wrote a paper which introduced the concepts of spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, the latter of which is the core mechanism behind the laser and maser, and which contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics.[13]\n",

    "In the middle part of his career, Einstein made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons. With physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, he laid the groundwork for Bose–Einstein statistics. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that ultimately proved unsuccessful. First, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that God does not play dice.[14] Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from mainstream modern physics.\n",
