       " Document(metadata={'source': 'study_10'}, page_content='Study: Postmenopausal Women Estrogen and Progesterone Infusion\\n\\nSummary: The purpose of the study is to study the effects of aging, estrogen and progesterone on the brain. Specifically, we want to look at how the hypothalamus and pituitary (two small glands in the brain) respond to estrogen. The pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) that signals the pituitary to secrete the reproductive hormones, LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone). These hormones act on the ovaries and signal the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen in the bloodstream then acts on the brain to modulate this system with changes in LH and FSH. Early changes associated with low levels of estrogen are inhibitory (estrogen negative feedback) while higher levels of estrogen (such as those present when a follicle in the ovary is ready to ovulate) stimulate LH to cause ovulation (positive feedback). This study will determine: 1) hypothalamic and pituitary levels of glucose uptake (as a measure of brain metabolic activity) at baseline and in association with estrogen negative feedback on LH (24 hr) and estrogen positive feedback on LH (72 hr); and 2) the effect of aging on estrogen feedback on LH, assessing negative feedback (nadir \\\\~ 24 hr) and positive feedback (peak between 72 and 96 hr).\\n\\nResults: Outcome: 18 FDG Uptake at the Hypothalamus During Estrogen Infusion: LH Negative Feedback.Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.02, CI NA-NA).

In a placebo-controlled extension of the base study, participants continued to receive the same blinded study medication for a total of up to 5 years of blinded study medication combined between the base study and the extension. After participants received 5 years of blinded study medication, they received open-label odanacatib through the end of the first extension. Participants were then invited to enroll in a second extension study in which they received open-label odanacatib for an additional 5 years. Two imaging substudies (PN032-Base/Extension and PN035) were conducted for participants in the MK-0822-018 Study. Additional safety information was collected for participants who discontinued from the base study or the blinded first extension in an observational follow-up study, MK-0822-083 (EudraCT number: 2007-002693-66) .\\n\\nResults: Outcome: Base Study + First Extension: Percent Change From Baseline in BMD Measurements of the Distal-Third Forearm.Parameters: Difference in Least Squares Means = 1.1 (p = 0.001, CI 0.66-1.54); Difference in Least Squares Means = 1.36 (p = 0.001, CI 0.87-1.85); Difference in Least Squares Means = 1.96 (p = 0.001, CI 1.42-2.5); Difference in Least Squares Means = 2.18 (p = 0.001, CI 1.4-2.96); Difference in Least Squares Means = 2.33 (p = 0.001, CI 1.54-3.11).

Osteoporosis is the term used to describe a large group of diseases, which are characterized by loss of bone density, which makes the bones weaker. Osteoporosis often occurs in postmenopausal women.\\n\\nCalcitonin is a hormone found in the human body.

Postmenopausal women with at least Stage 2 pelvic organ prolapse will receive either estrogen vaginal cream or placebo cream 6-8 weeks prior to reconstructive surgery. At time of surgery, full thickness biopsies will be obtained from a standardized location at the top of vagina. The investigators will measure the thickness of the vaginal muscularis, elastic fiber number and morphology, and analyze if elastic fiber synthesis or degradation is affected by estrogen therapy. The results will provide important data to support a larger clinical trial to determine if preoperative and maintenance estrogen therapy alter long-term success rates of pelvic reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ prolapse.\\n\\nResults: Outcome: Vaginal Wall Composition: Epithelium (Per-Protocol).Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.002, CI NA-NA).

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'study_66'}, page_content='Study: Brown Adipose Tissue Activity in Pre- and Postmenopausal Women\\n\\nSummary: The physiological relevance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans is largely unknown. The investigators have shown that suppressing ovarian function in premenopausal women reduces resting energy expenditure (REE), and this is prevented by adding back estradiol (E2). The investigators preliminary data suggest that this may be due, in part, to reduced brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity. The overarching hypothesis is that BAT activity in humans is modulated by E2. To determine if natural declines in endogenous E2 contribute to changes in BAT activity, we will compare BAT activity in pre-and post-menopausal women. The investigators will also explore whether suppression of ovarian hormones in pre-menopausal women impairs BAT activity. BAT activity will be quantified using dynamic positron emission topography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging combined with 11C-acetate tracers. We will assess the thermogenic response of BAT by measuring cold-induced changes in REE, shivering, and skin and core temperature.\\n\\nResults: Outcome: Brown Adipose Tissue Activity -Warm Exposure.Parameters: NA = NA (p = 1e-04, CI NA-NA).

An important role of increased cAMP levels in oocyte is shown to suppress meiotic progression. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) studies in animals have shown that expression of the natriuretic peptide precursor increases during the periovulatory period and shows that this increase decreases rapidly after Luteinizing hormone(LH) / human chorionic(hCG) stimulation. Human studies have shown that after ovulation induction, the CNP level in follicular fluid decreases following ovulatory dose of hCG (9).\\n\\nResults: Outcome: Serum C Type Natriuretic Peptide Levels.Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.017, CI NA-NA).

Wnt way (wingless-type MMTV integration site family) plays a role in the regulation of bone homeostasis in periodontal disease-induced bone resorption. The Wnt / β-catenin signal is controlled by physiological antagonists, including dickkopf released from osteocytes-associated protein 1 (DKK-1) and sclerostin (SOST). Thus, Wnt inhibitors SOST and DKK-1 affect bone mass changes. Bisphosphonates used in osteoporous treatment are selective inhibitors of bone resorption. In the serum of postmenopausal osteoporotic women treated with bisphosphonate, short-term and decreased DKK-1 level during the treatment, and increased SOST in the late period were reported. Increased bone formation after bisphosphonate treatment in postmenopausal osteoporotic patients has been associated with increased serum SOST level. The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate in patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis on the bone demolition metabolism in periodontally healthy and periodontally diseased tooth regions and gingival health with the clinical data by investigating the SOST and DDK-1 molecules that play role in bone destruction mechanism.\\n\\nResults: Outcome: Sost Values for 6th Month.Parameters: Mean Difference (Final Values) = 0.01 (p = 0.01, CI NA-NA).
