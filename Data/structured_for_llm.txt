Results: Outcome: Relative Change From Baseline at One Year (12 Months) in Mean Lumbar Spine (L2 - L4) Bone Mineral Density. Time frame: From Baseline (Month 0) to Month 12. Description: Relative change in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is the percentage change from baseline of BMD of vertebrae L2 - L4 that are not fractured and not affected by an osteoarthritic process to such a degree that accurate measurement of BMD would be considered jeopardized by the central reading center after 12 months of treatment. It is calculated as the sum of bone mineral content divided by the sum of area of all lumbar vertebrae L2 - L4 that are not fractured and not affected by an osteoarthritic process at Month 12. Participants available at particular time point for assessment were included in the analysis.. Parameters: Mean Difference (Final Values) = 0.615 (p = 0.045, CI 0.013-1.216); Mean Difference (Final Values) = 0.297 (p = 0.338, CI -0.312-0.906); Mean Difference (Final Values) = 1 (p = 0.001, CI 0.395-1.605).

Study: Vitamin K Supplementation in Post-Menopausal Osteopenia

Summary: The purpose of this study is to determine whether supplementation with 5 mg vitamin K daily over a 2-year period will prevent bone loss in post-menopausal women with osteopenia.

Detailed Description: Osteoporosis is major cause of morbidity and mortality in Canadian postmenopausal women. It is a systemic disease characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, resulting in bone fragility and an increased risk of fractures. One in six women over the age of 50 have osteoporosis. The lifetime risk of an osteoporotic fracture for an average 50 year-old Canadian woman is \>40%. The annual health care costs for osteoporotic fractures in Canada have been estimated to exceed $1.3 billion.

Recent data suggest that vitamin K supplements may decrease bone loss and prevent fractures. Vitamin K is a co-factor of gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in bone matrix proteins such as osteocalcin. Vitamin K has been reported to enhance bone formation in both in vitro studies and in vivo studies in animals. Vitamin K levels are low in individuals with osteoporosis and in patients with osteoporotic fractures. The few studies examining vitamin K supplementation in humans have showed promising results with no significant side effects, but these studies had significant methodological shortcomings such as inadequate sample size and lack of randomization.

The primary objective of our study is to examine whether vitamin K supplementation will increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. Our secondary objectives are to examine the possible adverse effects from long-term vitamin K supplementation, to investigate whether vitamin K will decrease risk of fractures and to determine if vitamin K affects quality of life. Our hypotheses are that vitamin K increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and that there are no significant adverse effects from vitamin K supplementation.

Study: European Active Surveillance Study of Women Taking Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

Summary: The objective of the active surveillance study is to compare incidence rates of serious adverse events in users of all types of newly prescribed oral continuous combined HRT products. The primary focus is the assessment of pertinent cardiovascular outcomes (such as venous and arterial thromboembolism) in new HRT users for up to 8.5 years.

Detailed Description: The safety of a novel drug product containing a new chemical entity should be assessed in an extensive post marketing safety surveillance program. It is also prudent to assess both, the safety outcomes that relate specifically to the targeted population, as well as those that could potentially be related to the special pharmacological characteristics of the novel drug product. Differentiating between the inherent background population risk and a potential incremental risk due to treatment is often challenging. Active safety surveillance using valid epidemiological study designs has been proven to be a pertinent and reliable method to approach this endeavour.

The primary objective of the study, the European Active Surveillance Study of Women taking HRT (EURAS-HRT), is to compare incidence rates of serious adverse events in users of all types of newly prescribed oral continuous combined HRT products. This active surveillance study will assess pertinent cardiovascular outcomes in new HRT users over a study period of up to 8.5 years. Also, all other serious adverse events will be reported.

The new drug product under surveillance in the EURAS - HRT study contains the novel synthetic progestagen drospirenone (DRSP) combined with estradiol.

As estrogen/progestagen combinations increase the risk for thromboembolism, all new drug products that contain a novel estrogen or progestagen should be investigated for their influence on venous and arterial thromboembolic events rates. A large, prospective, controlled cohort study of OC users (EURAS OC study), which compared DRSP-containing OC users with other OC users, demonstrated that DRSP is not associated with an increased incidence for any of the above-mentioned adverse events in OC users. However, because OC users are two to three decades younger than the typical HRT user the results of the OC study can only partially be extrapolated to older age groups.

The participating women will complete a baseline survey using a self-administered questionnaire to describe the baseline risk. After 6 months, 12 months, and then on an annual basis, they will fill out a questionnaire in which they record complaints and events during the use of the prescribed HRTs. All adverse outcomes (including cancer) occurring during the observational period will be evaluated additionally. Reported serious adverse events will be validated and analyzed. As study participants may switch from oral continuous combined products to other oral or non-oral HRT products the outcomes for these preparation are recorded too. However, these results represent not the scientific focus of the study.

Based on experience obtained in previous HRT studies, complex sources of bias and confounding are expected. Multivariate methods will therefore be used to adjust for confounding.

Results: Outcome: Relative Percent Change in Serum C-terminal Telopeptide of Type 1 Collagen Concentration (sCTX) From Baseline to Day 3. Time frame: Baseline (Visit 1) and Day 3. Description: Serum C-terminal Telopeptide of Type 1 Collagen (sCTX) is a biochemical marker for bone turnover that has been shown to detect increased bone resorption, a process by which bone is broken down within the body. It is measured in units of nanograms (ng) per milliliter (mL). The relative change in sCTX was defined as the relative difference between the value at each time point and the value at Baseline, using the following formula: Relative change = (sCTX time point- sCTX Baseline) / (sCTX Baseline) \* 100. The sCTX value used for Baseline was the average of the results from the 2 blood samples taken at screening. If 1 of these 2 samples was nonquantifiable or missing, then the Baseline sCTX was the result from the non-missing sample. Baseline visit was defined as Visit 1.. Parameters: Difference in median = -64.2 (p = 1e-04, CI -80.28--46.21). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER.

Study: Postmenopausal Women Estrogen and Progesterone Infusion

Summary: The purpose of the study is to study the effects of aging, estrogen and progesterone on the brain. Specifically, we want to look at how the hypothalamus and pituitary (two small glands in the brain) respond to estrogen. The pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) that signals the pituitary to secrete the reproductive hormones, LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone). These hormones act on the ovaries and signal the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen in the bloodstream then acts on the brain to modulate this system with changes in LH and FSH. Early changes associated with low levels of estrogen are inhibitory (estrogen negative feedback) while higher levels of estrogen (such as those present when a follicle in the ovary is ready to ovulate) stimulate LH to cause ovulation (positive feedback). This study will determine: 1) hypothalamic and pituitary levels of glucose uptake (as a measure of brain metabolic activity) at baseline and in association with estrogen negative feedback on LH (24 hr) and estrogen positive feedback on LH (72 hr); and 2) the effect of aging on estrogen feedback on LH, assessing negative feedback (nadir \~ 24 hr) and positive feedback (peak between 72 and 96 hr).

Detailed Description: The transition to menopause is characterized by a decline in the numbers of functional ovarian follicles followed by a decrease in levels of inhibin A and B and complex changes in estradiol, which include an initial increase followed by an inevitable decrease. Therefore, there are dynamic changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary feedback from the aging ovary, prior to the ultimate loss of feedback that occurs with the complete cessation of ovarian function. While there is ample evidence that the loss of ovarian function is a major contributor to the menopause, there is evidence from animal models that primary age-related neuroendocrine changes may also contribute to reproductive aging. Specifically, there is evidence for changes in the hypothalamic and pituitary responses to estrogen negative and positive feedback. An understanding of the age-related changes in the physiology of the hypothalamic and pituitary responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback is critical in determining whether hypothalamic and pituitary changes per se contribute to the menopause and the impact of the loss of reproductive function on the brain.

Study: Effect of Race on Gonadotropin Responses

Summary: The purpose of this study is to attempt to determine why estrogen levels are increased in African-American women as compared to Caucasian women by evaluating estrogen feedback on the brain. African-American women have increased bone mineral density, higher rates of twins, greater incidence of fibroids, and increased incidence of breast cancer below 40 years of age as compared to Caucasian women. These traits or illnesses are all believed to be estrogen-dependent. In fact, previous research has demonstrated increased estrogen levels in African-American women as compared to Caucasian women. However, the reason for these differences in estrogen levels has not been studied in humans. One possibility is that estrogen feedback on the brain differs between African-American and Caucasian women. Two small glands in the brain (hypothalamus and pituitary) respond to estrogen. The hypothalamus secretes GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) that signals the pituitary to secrete the reproductive hormones, LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone). These hormones act on the ovaries and signal the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen in the bloodstream then acts on the brain to stop this system when the blood has enough estrogen levels. This is called estrogen feedback. This study will determine whether there are differences in estrogen feedback between African-American and Caucasian women.

Detailed Description: Several independent lines of evidence have suggested that reproductive endocrine dynamics may differ between African-American (AAW) and Caucasian (CW) women. There is an increased incidence of dizygotic twinning in African-American women and a further increase in the incidence reported in African women compared to Caucasian, Hispanic and Asian populations. While the etiology of dizygotic twinning is not well understood, an increase in its incidence may imply an alteration in the integrated control of the reproductive axis which usually favors development of a single ovulatory follicle. It is widely appreciated that the incidence of leiomyomas is increased in African-American women. Growth factors are likely to play a role in their control, but there is also ample evidence that leiomyomas are responsive to gonadal steroids, decreasing in size following the menopause and in response to hypoestrogenism caused by gonadotropin downregulation. African-American women under 40 years of age have a higher risk of breast cancer than women of all other ethnicities in that age group, again raising the question of whether there are also differences in reproductive hormone dynamics. Finally, bone density is increased in African-American women. In a cross-sectional study of 54 African-American and 39 Caucasian women between the ages of 20 and 90, Perry et al found that the increase in bone density in AAW was associated with increased serum levels of both estradiol and testosterone. Woods et al also described increased levels of estradiol, estrone and androstenedione levels in AAW compared with control women on a controlled low-fat, high-fiber diet. In contrast, a recent longitudinal cohort study has suggested that AAW have lower levels of estradiol with increasing age and BMI in comparison with CW. We have compared reproductive hormone levels in AAW and CW \< 35 years old with a history of regular ovulatory cycles. Our preliminary data indicate that in comparison to age and BMI matched CW, estradiol levels are consistently elevated across the cycle in AAW in the absence of changes in LH, FSH, progesterone, inhibin A or inhibin B. These relationships suggest both altered negative and forward feedback interrelationships between FSH and LH and estradiol in the setting of normal inhibin levels. In the current protocol we will seek to understand the mechanisms underlying these feedback differences, which have never been addressed in these populations.

A graded infusion of estradiol and progesterone can be used to assess differences in negative and positive feedback of gonadal steroids on LH and FSH. We have hypothesized that differences exist in feedback regulation of the hypothalamus and pituitary as a function of African-American or Caucasian race in reproductive aged women.

Results: Outcome: LH Peak in Response to Estrogen Positive Feedback. Time frame: 5 days of estradiol and progesterone infusion. Description: Estradiol levels are consistently higher in African-American vs Caucasian women across the menstrual cycle. This study was designed to determine if African-American women are more sensitive to estrogen positive feedback to generate the preovulatory LH surge using a controlled estrogen infusion paradigm.. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.69, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY.

Study: A Study of MK-0822 in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis to Assess Fracture Risk (MK-0822-018)

Summary: The purpose of the event-driven base study is to determine the safety and efficacy, especially fracture risk reduction, of odanacatib in postmenopausal women diagnosed with osteoporosis. In a placebo-controlled extension of the base study, participants continued to receive the same blinded study medication for a total of up to 5 years of blinded study medication combined between the base study and the extension. After participants received 5 years of blinded study medication, they received open-label odanacatib through the end of the first extension. Participants were then invited to enroll in a second extension study in which they received open-label odanacatib for an additional 5 years. Two imaging substudies (PN032-Base/Extension and PN035) were conducted for participants in the MK-0822-018 Study. Additional safety information was collected for participants who discontinued from the base study or the blinded first extension in an observational follow-up study, MK-0822-083 (EudraCT number: 2007-002693-66) .

Study: Dose-Finding Safety and Efficacy Trial of Org 50081 (Esmirtazapine) in the Treatment of Vasomotor Symptoms (177001/P06472/MK-8265-013)

Summary: To investigate efficacy and safety of 4 doses of esmirtazapine, compared to placebo, in the treatment of moderate to severe hot flushes (vasomotor symptoms) associated with the menopause. Co-primary efficacy endpoints are the frequency and severity of hot flushes after 4 and 12 weeks as compared to Baseline.

Detailed Description: The most direct treatment of hot flushes may be by means of 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. Mirtazapine is a potent blocker of 5-HT2A receptors and was found to be effective in reducing the number and intensity of hot flushes in preliminary trials. Also several Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and other similar compounds have been investigated to manage hot flushes, confirming the role of the serotonergic system. In the present trial, the efficacy and safety of four different doses of esmirtazapine compared to placebo were investigated in women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause. The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate superior efficacy in at least one of the four doses of esmirtazapine as compared to placebo on the four following co-primary endpoints: 1) the mean change from baseline in average daily frequency of moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 4; 2) the mean change from baseline in average daily frequency of moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 12; 3) the mean change from baseline in average daily severity of moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 4; 4) the mean change from baseline in average daily severity of moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 12. The number and severity of hot flushes was recorded by means of electronic diary by the subjects.

Results: Outcome: Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 12. Time frame: Baseline and Week 12. Description: Participants recorded the frequency (number) of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency Score A was based on the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.. Parameters: Difference between least squares means = -1 (p = 0.08, CI -2.1-0.1); Difference between least squares means = -1.6 (p = 0.01, CI -2.7--0.5); Difference between least squares means = -1.5 (p = 0.01, CI -2.7--0.4); Difference between least squares means = -2 (p = 0.01, CI -3.1--0.9).

Time frame: Baseline and Week 12. Description: Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity Score A was calculated as the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of moderate and severe hot flushes per week. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as 'no sensation of heat'. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days.

Study: A Study Using Imaging Technology to Measure Changes in Bone Structure After Treatment With Teriparatide

Summary: The purpose of this study is to use imaging technologies to demonstrate the effects of teriparatide on bone structure following 18 to 24 months of therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Detailed Description: As teriparatide is approved for up to 24 months of treatment in the US, patients will be given the option to continue in a 6-month extension phase upon completion of 18 months of teriparatide treatment. This extension will allow for collection of additional bone quality data. In Canada, the use of teriparatide is currently approved for 18 months. Patients in Canada may be given the opportunity to participate in the 6-month extension phase, contingent upon Health Canada approval of the use of teriparatide treatment for 24 months.

Study: Dose-Finding Safety and Efficacy Trial of Org50081 (Esmirtazapine) in the Treatment of Vasomotor Symptoms (46101/P06459/MK-8265-012)

Summary: The most direct treatment of vasomotor symptions (hot flushes) may be by means of 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. Mirtazapine is a potent blocker of 5-HT2A receptors and was found to be effective in reducing the number and intensity of hot flushes in preliminary trials. Also several Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and other similar compounds have been investigated to manage hot flushes, confirming the role of the serotonergic system. In the present trial, the efficacy and safety of four different doses of esmirtazapine compared to placebo was investigated in women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause. The primary study hypothesis was that esmirtazapine would show superior efficacy to placebo.

Detailed Description: NA

Results: Outcome: Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 12. Time frame: Baseline and Week 12. Description: Participants recorded the frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency score A was based on the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward..

Study: Sex Hormones and Atherosclerosis Prevention in Perimenopausal Women

Summary: The purpose of this study is to find out why women's arteries stiffen as they go through menopause, and how this is affected by estrogen loss. We believe that arteries stiffen with the loss of estrogen because of "oxidative stress," the production of molecules that can damage cells and tissues in the body, and because the arteries lose their ability to expand, or dilate.

Detailed Description: As women get older and go through menopause, estradiol levels decrease. Also with aging, the arteries that are located around the heart get stiffer. Over time this increase in arterial stiffness can lead to a number of health problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease. In this study we want to find out if a short-term drop in estrogen levels in premenopausal and perimenopausal women can cause arteries to become stiffer, and why this happens. Additionally, in postmenopausal women, we want to find out if a short-term increase in estrogen levels causes their arteries to become more flexible (less stiff).

Arterial health (i.e., stiffness) will be examined in premenopausal, perimenopausal and postmenopausal women before and after they are given a drug called Ganirelix™ (for 7 days), which will markedly lower their reproductive hormones. After the first 4 days of taking Ganirelix™, the women will be randomly placed into 1 of 2 treatment groups to take either estrogen (0.075 mg/d skin patch) replacement or placebo for the rest of the Ganirelix treatment. This is to increase estrogen levels back to the normal level. After having the patch on for 4 days, arterial health will be examined again.

Pre-specified Outcome Measures were divided into unit-of-measurement specific Outcome Measure tables for the purposes of results reporting to ClinicalTrials.gov

Study: Efficacy and Safety of Odanacatib (MK-0822) in Participants With Involutional Osteoporosis (MK-0822-022)

Summary: The purpose of this study is to assess the dose-response on the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar vertebrae 1 to 4 (L1- L4) when odanacatib (MK-0822) 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or placebo is orally administered once weekly for 52 weeks to Japanese involutional osteoporosis participants. The study will also assess safety and tolerability of odanacatib (10, 25, and 50 mg) in these participants.

The study will enroll approximately 280 participants and randomly assign them to 3 different doses of odanacatib or placebo for 52 weeks, along with supplemental vitamin D3 and calcium carbonate. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that a dose-response relationship on the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD (L1- L4) is seen when odanacatib 10, 25, 50 mg or placebo is orally administered once weekly for 52 weeks to involutional osteoporosis participants. The primary safety hypothesis is that odanacatib will be safe and well tolerated over 52 weeks to involutional osteoporosis participants.

Study: MsFLASH-01: Escitalopram for Menopausal Symptoms in Midlife Women

Summary: The purpose of this study is to test whether a medication reduces the number, severity and bothersomeness of menopausal hot flashes. Escitalopram (also called Lexapro®) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It is sold by prescription for depression and general anxiety disorder. An SSRI increases serotonin, a brain substance that is believed to influence mood. Serotonin may also affect brain levels of estradiol, a hormone related to hot flashes. This research study will test whether escitalopram reduces menopausal hot flashes.

Detailed Description: The MsFLASH-01 study, Efficacy of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) for Menopausal Symptoms in Midlife Women is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm clinical trial. The design includes: 3 weeks of daily recording of hot flashes prior to drug treatment; 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram or placebo with dose escalation at 4 weeks among non-responders; 1 week of drug taper for those on higher dose, followed by 2 weeks with no treatment; and a telephone follow-up post-treatment. This study is one of five clinical trials to be conducted as part of the Menopause Strategies - Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) study, a network of investigators and clinical trials designed to find new ways to alleviate the most common, bothersome symptoms of the menopausal transition.

Results: Outcome: Change in Daily Frequency of Hot Flashes Between Baseline and Week 8 as Assessed by Prospective Daily Diaries. Time frame: week 8 minus baseline. Description: Change in daily hot flash frequency was calculated as the daily mean difference between baseline and week 8. Baseline was calculated as the daily mean of the frequencies for the first two screening weeks. Week 8 was calculated as the daily mean of the daily frequencies during the week prior to the week 8 visit.. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.001, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER. Outcome: Change in Daily Severity of Hot Flashes Between Baseline and Week 8 as Assessed by Prospective Daily Diaries. Time frame: week 8 minus baseline. Description: Change in daily hot flash severity between baseline \& week 8 was calculated as mean difference. Baseline severity ratings were calculated as daily mean ratings for the first two screening weeks pre-baseline. Week 8 severity ratings were calculated as daily mean ratings during the week before week 8. Modified intention to treat analysis included all randomized participants who provided diary data, which were analyzed regardless of adherence to treatment assignment. Hot flash severity was rated as 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) as adopted from the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN).. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.001, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER. Outcome: Secondary Outcome: Change in Daily Hot Flash Bother Between Baseline and Week 8 as Recorded on Daily Diaries. Time frame: week 8 minus baseline.

Study: Flaxseed in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Hot Flashes Who Have a History of Breast Cancer or Other Cancer or Who Do Not Wish to Take Estrogen Therapy

Summary: RATIONALE: Estrogen can relieve the symptoms of menopause, but can also cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Flaxseed may reduce the number of hot flashes and improve mood and quality of life in postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying flaxseed to see how well it works in treating postmenopausal women with hot flashes who have a history of breast cancer or other cancer or who do not wish to take estrogen therapy.

Detailed Description: OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the efficacy of flaxseed on hot flash scores in women with a history of breast cancer or other cancer or in women who do not wish to take estrogen therapy for fear of increased risk of breast cancer as measured by a daily prospective hot flash diary.
* To evaluate the side effect profile of flaxseed in this population.
* To evaluate the effects of flaxseed on mood (per the Profile of Mood States) and broader menopausal symptoms (per the MENQOL), daily interference from hot flashes (per the HFRDIS), and perception of benefit (per Global Impression of Change).

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (18-49 years vs ≥ 50 years); treatment with tamoxifen citrate, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or aromatase inhibitors (yes vs no); duration of hot flashes (≤ 9 months vs \> 9 months); and daily frequency of hot flashes (4-9 vs ≥ 10). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral flaxseed in the form of a bar similar to a granola bar once daily.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo bar once daily. In both arms, treatment continues for 6-12 weeks. Patients in arm II may crossover to receive treatment as in arm I after 6 weeks.

Patients complete questionnaires (Hot Flash Diary, Side Effect Experience Questionnaire, Profile of Mood States, Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale, and Menopause Specific Quality of Life) at baseline and periodically during treatment. Patients are contacted by telephone at the end of weeks 2, 4, 5, and 7 to assess product tolerability, document compliance, encourage completion of questionnaires, and address problems.

Results: Outcome: Change of Daily Interference as Measured by the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS). Time frame: Baseline and up to 7 weeks. Description: The change of daily interference as measured by the HFRDIS from baseline to treatment termination between flaxseed versus placebo arms was evaluated with an independent t-test for continuous data. On a 0-10 scale, patients were asked to describe how hot flashes interfered with 10 different aspects of their life (work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep, mood, concentration, relationships with others, sexuality, enjoyment of life and overall quality of life). Scores were converted to a 0-100 scale where 100 is best QOL.The HFRDIS total score was the average of the 10 individual questions. The change in total score from baseline to end of treatment was analyzed between the groups using a Kruskal-Wallace test.. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.089, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER. Outcome: Change of Menopause Specific Quality of Life as Measured by the Menopause Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL). Time frame: Baseline and up to 7 weeks. Description: The change in quality of life as measured by the MENQOL from baseline to treatment termination between flaxseed versus placebo arms was evaluated. On a 0-6 scale, patients were asked to answer questions in in each of 4 domain scores (Vasomotor, Psychosocial, Physical, Sexual) Scores were converted to a 0-100 scale where 100 is best QOL. The change in score from baseline to end of treatment were analyzed separately for each domain. Here we report the mean change in score for each category.. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.19, CI NA-NA); NA = NA (p = 0.78, CI NA-NA); NA = NA (p = 0.238, CI NA-NA); NA = NA (p = 0.497, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER. Outcome: Change of Mood as Measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Time frame: Baseline and up to 7 weeks. Description: Profile of Mood States (POMS) was used to look at total mood disturbance as well as the subscales of tension-anxiety, fatigue-inertia, and vigor-activity. The POMS is a well known, well validated, reliable measure of psychological distress which includes 6 subscales of fatigue-inertia, vigor-activity, tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, and confusion-bewilderment. The entire scale can be scored to provide a measure of total mood disturbance. The measure contains adjectives related to mood which are scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Individual scores were converted to a 0-100 scale where 100 is best quality of life.

The change of mood as measured by the POMS from baseline to treatment termination between flaxseed versus placebo arms was compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. The mean change in total score for each arm is reported.. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.93, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER. Outcome: To Evaluate the Efficacy of Flaxseed on Hot Flash Scores in Women as Measured by a Daily Prospective Hot Flash Diary.. Time frame: Baseline and 7 weeks. Description: The intra-patient difference in hot flash activity between baseline (study week 1) and treatment termination (study week 7) is the primary endpoint. The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes.

The hot flash severities are graded from 1 to 4, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe to very severe. The daily hot flash score is computed by multiplying the mean grade of severity by the frequency during every 24 hour period. Therefore, a score of zero is the lowest possible score and can be interpreted as having no hot flashes. The average daily hot flash score during the baseline week was compared to the average daily value during week 7.

The primary method of analysis will be the independent sample t-test to examine the change of weekly average hot flash score from baseline to treatment termination between flaxseed and placebo arms.. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.29, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER.
Study: A Study Comparing Oral Calcitonin to Nasal Spray Calcitonin in Postmenopausal Osteoporotic Women

Summary: The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of two medications, calcitonin nasal spray and a tablet containing calcitonin, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is the term used to describe a large group of diseases, which are characterized by loss of bone density, which makes the bones weaker. Osteoporosis often occurs in postmenopausal women.

Calcitonin is a hormone found in the human body. Together with other substances, it regulates the concentration of calcium in the blood and inhibits the natural resorption of bone. Both medications in this study contain salmon calcitonin (sCT), because this form of calcitonin is more active than human calcitonin when used as a medicine.

The calcitonin Nasal Spray used in this study is registered and available to doctors in United States for the treatment of osteoporosis. The medication being tested in this study is an oral tablet form of salmon calcitonin.

Detailed Description: This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multiple dose, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 48- week, Phase III study. Women age 45 and over who were postmenopausal and had a diagnosis of osteoporosis were eligible for the study and were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups; placebo tablets, oral rsCT tablets or calcitonin nasal spray. Each patient was given a treatment kit, which contained the study medication to which she had been assigned and a placebo of the treatment to which she was not assigned, or placebo nasal and oral preparations, as well as the required dietary supplements (calcium and vitamin D tablets). The study medication and supplements were self-administered at home. It was anticipated that approximately 545 patients would participate in the study.

EFFICACY: Bone Mineral Density (BMD) was recorded at Screening, Week 24, and Week 48. CTx-1 and N-telopeptide of collagen 1 (NTx-1), biochemical markers of bone resorption and total Procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP),a marker of bone formation, were assessed at Week 0, Week 24, and Week 48. SAFETY: Adverse events were assessed at the clinic at Weeks 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48, and by interim phone calls at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, and 52. At Screening, Week 12, and Week 48, a physical examination, including nasal exam, was performed and specimens for safety laboratory analysis (clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) were collected. Sera for immunogenicity evaluations were collected at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 48.

EFFICACY: The primary comparison of interest was the percent change from baseline to 48 weeks in axial lumbar spine (L1 to L4) corrected BMD comparing the rsCT oral tablet group and the calcitonin nasal spray group. The model included the factors of the covariate (baseline BMD), treatment group, and center. The hypothesis to be tested was performed to examine the non-inferiority of the oral tablet group to the nasal spray group with respect to the percent change in axial lumbar L1-L4 spine corrected BMD. Specifically, the null hypothesis to be tested was: \[Mean(oral) - Mean(placebo)\] - 0.5 x \[Mean(nasal) - Mean(placebo)\] \< 0 The alternative hypothesis was that the above expression was \> 0, which implied that the oral tablet group was non-inferior to nasal spray group. The primary analysis of interest employed the modified intent-to-treat population.

SAFETY: Adverse events were summarized descriptively. Mean vital signs and clinical laboratory test results in each treatment group were compared using a one-way analysis of variance. Additionally, shift tables were prepared for each laboratory variable.

Results: Outcome: Change in Plasma C-terminal Telopeptide of Collagen 1 (CTx-1). Time frame: 24 weeks. Description: Change from baseline in plasma CTx-1 at 24 and 48 weeks. CTx-1 is an accepted plasma biomarker as evidence of an effect on bone resorption and the effect of oral calcitonin was compared to that of intranasal calcitonin, both vs placebo.. Parameters: Mean Difference (Net) = -21.84 (p = 6e-04, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: NON_INFERIORITY_OR_EQUIVALENCE. Outcome: Change in Plasma CTx-1 From Baseline. Time frame: 48 weeks. Description: Percent change from baseline of plasma CTx-1 at end of study=48 weeks. Parameters: Mean Difference (Net) = -18.09 (p = 0.0012, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: NON_INFERIORITY_OR_EQUIVALENCE. Outcome: Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of Axial Lumbar Spine. Time frame: 48 weeks. Description: Bone Mineral Density is measured by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) body scans. Two scans were taken for each timepoint(baseline, week 24 and week 48) and the mean of the two values was entered. The primary outcome timepoint was 48 weeks, but if a patient did not complete the full study, then the 24 week BMD value was used as Last Observation Carried Forward. The percentage change from the baseline value, set as 0%, was recorded as the primary outcome measure.. Parameters: Mean Difference (Net) = 0.77 (p = 0.002, CI 0.08-1.45). Non-inferiority type: NON_INFERIORITY_OR_EQUIVALENCE.
Study: Efficacy and Safety of S-equol on Vasomotor Symptoms in Menopausal Patients

Summary: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of S-equol in menopausal patients with hot flushes and night sweats.

Detailed Description: The study is a randomized, double blind, multicenter, placebo controlled, parallel group, proof of concept study comparing the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of 3 doses of S-equol to placebo in menopausal patients with vasomotor symptoms. The study objective is an evaluation of the dose response of 3 dose levels of AUS-131 (S-equol) and placebo with respect to reducing the mean number of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment. The safety of S-equol will be evaluated during the study.

Results: Outcome: Change From Baseline (Day 0) in Vaginal pH at Week 2 and Week 4. Time frame: 2 and 4 weeks from Baseline (Day 0). Description: The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a substance is. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic. A pH greater than 7 is basic. The pH scale is logarithmic and as a result, each whole pH value below 7 is ten times more acidic than the next higher value.

Normal vaginal pH is 3.8 to 4.5, slightly acidic.

Study: MK-5442 in the Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Previously Treated With an Oral Bisphosphonate (MK-5442-012)

Summary: This study seeks to demonstrate that additional gain in bone mineral density (BMD) can be achieved by switching to MK-5442 from an oral bisphosphonate in participants who have been receiving oral bisphosphonate therapy for at least 3 years.

Detailed Description: The study was originally planned for a duration of 2 years and included efficacy analysis of a 15 mg MK-5442 treatment arm. Amendment 1 of the protocol eliminated the 2nd year of the study as well the 15-mg arm. Enrollment into the 15-mg MK-5442 arm was stopped as a result of the amendment and all participants who had been randomly assigned to the MK-5442 15-mg treatment arm were discontinued from the study.

Study: Research Investigation of Soy and Estrogen

Summary: The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of oral estradiol and soy phytoestrogens on anxiety, stress responsivity and cognition in perimenopausal women.

Detailed Description: Anxiety is a common, but understudied complaint in midlife women, and increases during the menopausal transition. Changes in estrogen are dramatic during the menopausal transition, and indirect data suggest a potential role for estrogen, particularly estrogen receptor beta, in mediating anxiety. Two subtypes of the estrogen receptor, alpha and beta (ER-alpha and ER-beta), appear to be critically involved in the expression of anxiety in females. Compounds that preferentially target ER-beta, including plant-derived estrogens (phytoestrogens), lower both anxiety behaviors and responsivity to discrete stressors, including social stress, in laboratory animals. The primary aim of this proposal is to carry out the first study to translate these preclinical studies to humans by comparing and contrasting of the effects of phytoestrogens, estradiol, and placebo on daily anxiety and responses to moderate psychosocial stress in the laboratory. As second focus is emotional and non-emotional cognition. This focus stems from evidence that estrogen can protect against the negative impact of glucocorticoids on memory. These aims will be accomplished in a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled, clinical trial comparing three treatments: 1) a phytoestrogen supplement (Novasoy® 400, 55 mg tablet twice daily); 2) oral estradiol (1 mg/daily; plus 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate at study end 10 for 10 days); and 3) placebo (identical appearing tablets twice daily). The enrollment target is 120 healthy women in the menopausal transition (40 per group). To measure anxiety, women will complete the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). To measure responsivity to psychosocial stress, parallel forms of the Trier Social Stress Test, a widely used laboratory induction that involves unanticipated public speaking and social evaluative fear, will be used to induce moderate psychosocial stress before and after treatment. At both laboratory sessions, measures of subjective stress (STAI), cortisol, and emotional memory performance will be obtained at multiple points during a control condition and during the psychosocial stress condition. Lastly, we will measure treatment effects on measures of verbal memory.

Study: Early Menopause Hormone Treatment and Cognition

Summary: The objective of this study is to evaluate the neurobiological effects of hormone therapy (HT) in healthy early postmenopausal women. The studies proposed in this project seek to define the association between different hormone forms (estradiol only and progesterone only) versus placebo on brain functional measures. The functional measures will include the performance of the volunteers on a comprehensive neuropsychological testing battery, and the brain functional responses to episodic memory (verbal and non-verbal) challenges as well as emotional processing determined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Detailed Description: Specific Aims

Aim 1. To examine the effects of estradiol alone on brain functioning in early post-menopausal women during verbal and non-verbal cognitive tasks.

Hypothesis: It is expected that with estradiol treatment brain activation will be more prominent in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortical areas compared to placebo. The magnitude of activation in these regions will be positively correlated with task performance in the scanner and with the results of neuropsychological tests assessing verbal and non-verbal delayed recall.

Aim 2. To determine the effects of progesterone alone on brain functioning in early postmenopausal women during verbal and non-verbal cognitive tasks.

Hypothesis: It is expected that with progesterone treatment brain activation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortical areas will be decreased compared to both the placebo condition (within subjects) and the estradiol condition (between subjects). Interindividual variations in the magnitude of activation in these regions will be positively correlated with task performance in the scanner and with the results of neuropsychological tests assessing verbal and non-verbal delayed recall.

Aim 3. To determine the individual effects of estradiol and progesterone on brain functioning in early postmenopausal women during emotional processing stimuli.

Hypothesis: During negative stimuli estradiol-treated women compared to placebo group, are expected to have increased activity in the amygdala, posterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex, while in progesterone-treated women compared to placebo, decreased activity is expected in these brain regions.

Results: Outcome: Changes in Brain Activation Patterns in Verbal Tasks Determined With the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Scans. Time frame: August 2010 - March 2012. Description: Measure the changes in brain activity in verbal tasks with hormone use (either estradiol or progesterone) versus placebo.

The test is a deep and shallow verbal processing task, where the subjects are presented lists of words, one word at a time, and are asked to make one of 2 decisions about each list. One decision is whether each word is written in upper or lower case letters (shallow processing), and the other decision is whether each word denotes an abstract or concrete concept (deep processing).

Study: A Study of Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone With or Without Exemestane in Postmenopausal Women With Estrogen Receptor-Positive (ER+) Metastatic Breast Cancer Progressing After Letrozole or Anastrozole Therapy

Summary: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of oral abiraterone acetate plus oral prednisone and oral abiraterone acetate plus oral prednisone plus oral exemestane, each compared with oral exemestane alone, in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) metastatic (spreading) breast cancer that has relapsed after treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.

Detailed Description: This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all participants will know the identity of the assigned study drug) study divided into three phases, screening, treatment, and follow-up. During screening, potential patients will be assessed for study eligibility after providing signed informed consent. The treatment phase will comprise a series of 28-day cycles with continuous study treatment until breast cancer progression, when an end-of-treatment visit will be completed before the follow-up phase begins. The duration of participation in the study for an individual patient may be up to approximately 7 years, including follow-up evaluations. Patients will be evaluated for the safety and effectiveness of study treatments. During the treatment phase, patients will take the following study drugs by mouth once daily: abiraterone acetate, 1 g/day, as four 250-mg tablets, on an empty stomach, and patients must not eat for at least 1 hour after abiraterone acetate; prednisone (prednisolone when prednisone is not available), 5 mg/day; and exemestane, 25 mg/day, as a single tablet. The treatment phase will consist of a series of 28-day cycles with continuous study treatment until breast cancer progression. At the planned interim analysis, the Data Review Committee has recommended that further randomization to the abiraterone acetate alone group be stopped and that the study is to be continued otherwise.

Summary: The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of both low-dose oral (by mouth) 17-ß-estradiol and the non-hormonal drug venlafaxine XR compared to placebo in reducing hot flashes. Included in this objective is the intention to compare venlafaxine XR to estradiol therapy, to provide evidence of the relative efficacy of venlafaxine to what is currently considered the most established but also a controversial therapy. 17-ß-estradiol is a type of estrogen. Venlafaxine XR is the extended release (XR) version of venlafaxine. Venlafaxine XR is an serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). A placebo is a substance containing no medication.

Detailed Description: The MsFLASH-03 study (Menopausal Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health - 03), Comparative Efficacy of Low-Dose Estradiol and the SNRI Venlafaxine XR for Treatment of Menopausal Symptoms, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three arm clinical trial. The design includes: 3 weeks of daily recording of hot flashes prior to drug treatment; 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with oral estradiol, venlafaxine, or placebo; followed by 14 days of drug taper for those on venlafaxine and 14 days of progesterone treatment for those on estradiol; followed by 2 weeks with no treatment for all groups; and a telephone follow-up post-treatment.

Study: Therapy to Prevent Sexual Pain in Breast Cancer Survivors

Summary: The purpose of this protocol is to determine whether pain with sexual intercourse can be reduced in menopausal, breast cancer survivors and to evaluate the effectiveness of a non-hormonal therapy (Lidocaine Liquid) vs. a placebo liquid in reducing pain.

The investigators hypothesize that the pain arises in the vulvar vestibule. The investigators predict that the localized use of lidocaine will be more efficacious than use of placebo liquid.

Detailed Description: For this study there will be three visits over a 3 month period. Subjects will undergo a gynecological exam at the screening visit to determine the severity of pain associated with uncomfortable intercourse. A touch test using Q-tips will be used during screening exam so subjects can report pain during application of both study drug and placebo. Subjects will also report pain during tampon test. A sample of vaginal cells and liquid will be obtained at screening visit so that PI can rule out possible infection, disease, or disorders. PI will also show subject the area of the vestibule in a mirror so that subject can apply study drug at home properly. Subjects will fill out 4 questionnaires about medical and health history, cancer history, pain, and distress and sexual activity. Subject will be given a supply of either study drug or placebo to take home. The first visit will last approximately 2 hours.

Subjects will return for a second visit after 4 weeks and a third visit after 8 weeks for diary review, questionnaires, and examination. The second and third visit examinations will be repeats of the examination done at the first visit, but there will be no comparison with placebo, the PI will use only study drug during the touch test. The second and third visits will last approximately 1 hour.

Subjects will fill out questionnaires throughout study participation. Topics include; medical and health history, cancer history, pain, distress and sexual activity. Subjects will also fill out a diary that charts tampon test completed from home, sexual activity performed, pain levels and study drug application days.

Study: Homeopathic Treatment for Depression in Peri- and Postmenopausal Women

Summary: The aim of this study was to determine whether individualized homeopathic treatment and fluoxetine are more efficient than placebo for moderate to severe depression in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Detailed Description: Perimenopausal period is characterized by an increased risk of depressive symptoms. Major depression is one of the most disabling medical conditions worldwide. At present, it is becoming more difficult to prove that antidepressants actually work better than placebo in clinical trials.Use of homeopathy to treat depression is widespread, but there is a lack of clinical trails about its efficacy in depression in peri- and postmenopausal women. Previous trials suggest that individualized homeopathic treatments improve depression in general population. The purpose of this study was to determine whether individualized homeopathic treatment and fluoxetine are more efficient than placebo for moderate depression in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Outcome: Proportion of Participants With New Vertebral Fractures. Time frame: Baseline through 24 Months. Description: The incidence of new vertebral fractures was assessed by quantitative vertebral morphometry measurements (QM) with qualitative visual semiquantitative grading (SQ) confirmation.

A new vertebral fracture was diagnosed in a vertebra that was non-fractured at the baseline radiological examination. It was defined as a loss of vertebral body height of at least 20% and 4 mm from the baseline radiograph by vertebral QM, based upon placement of six points by a trained, central reader. Any fractures identified by QM were confirmed using SQ: if the vertebral body also had an increase of one or more severity grade, it was considered an incident vertebral fracture.. Parameters: Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.4071 (p = 9.4e-05, CI 0.256-0.647); Risk Ratio (RR) = 0.4431 (p = 9.4e-05, CI 0.29-0.677). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY.

Study: Effect of Preoperative Estrogen Treatment on Connective Tissues of the Pelvic Floor

Summary: This is a study to determine how vaginal estrogen cream given for several weeks before pelvic reconstructive therapy will effect elastic fiber assembly in the muscularis layer of the vaginal wall. Postmenopausal women with at least Stage 2 pelvic organ prolapse will receive either estrogen vaginal cream or placebo cream 6-8 weeks prior to reconstructive surgery. At time of surgery, full thickness biopsies will be obtained from a standardized location at the top of vagina. The investigators will measure the thickness of the vaginal muscularis, elastic fiber number and morphology, and analyze if elastic fiber synthesis or degradation is affected by estrogen therapy. The results will provide important data to support a larger clinical trial to determine if preoperative and maintenance estrogen therapy alter long-term success rates of pelvic reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ prolapse.

Study: Effect and Safety of Electroacupuncture for Symptoms of Menopausal Transition

Summary: The primary object is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for symptoms of women during menopausal transition .

Detailed Description: Menopause transition is called perimenopause in the past time. 40-80% women aged 40 to 65 have symptoms during this period. Hormone therapy is the recommended therapy for menopause and there is not enough evidence in favor of alternative medicine's effect.

Our pilot trial showed that electroacupuncture had better effect for menopause transition symptoms than sham electroacupuncture. We are going to conduct a phase Ⅱ clinical trial to further evaluate the safety and effect of electroacupuncture for menopause transition symptoms.

Results: Outcome: Change From Baseline in Menopause Rating Scale Total Score. Time frame: at baseline and week 8. Description: The change in menopause rating scale (MRS) total score compared with baseline at week 8 equals MRS total score at week 8 minus MRS total score at baseline.

MRS is a self-report questionnaire for evaluating the severity of menopausal symptoms in women, which contains 11 items. Each of the 11 symptoms contained a scoring scale from "0" (no complaints) to "4" (very severe symptoms). The total score will be calculated as the all items ranging from 0 to 44, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms. The MRS including 3 dimensions: psychological, somatic-vegetative, and urogenital.. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.05, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY.
Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of the Combination Estradiol and Progesterone to Treat Vasomotor Symptoms

Summary: This study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter trial of postmenopausal subjects with an intact uterus.

Detailed Description: Postmenopausal subjects with an intact uterus who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized to one of five treatment arms (four active and one placebo) and followed for 12 months. During the Screening period all subjects will be provided with a diary to self-assess the frequency and severity of their vasomotor symptoms. Subjects experiencing a minimum daily frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot flushes will participate in a VMS Substudy during the first 12 weeks of treatment. The Substudy subjects will be stratified by treatment arm within the sites, and only Substudy subjects have the possibility of being randomized to placebo. Subjects who qualify for the study except for experiencing a minimum daily frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot flushes will be stratified within sites to one of the four active treatment arms and followed for 12 months, but will not participate in the VMS Substudy. (However, VMS information will be collected from all subjects during the first 12 weeks of treatment.) All Study Subjects: Postmenopausal women with an intact uterus who seek relief from hot flushes and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible for 12 months of study treatment.

VMS Substudy Subjects: A subset of All Study Subjects who have ≥7 per day or ≥50 per week moderate to severe hot flushes (as determined during Screening) are eligible for the 12-week VMS Substudy and for a total of 12 months of study treatment.

Clinical evaluations will be performed at the following time points:

* Screening Period (Week: - 8.5) (up to -60 Days)
* Visit 1 Randomization (Week 0) (Day 1)
* Visit 2 Interim (Week 4)
* Visit 3 Interim (Week 8)
* Visit 4 Interim (Week 12)
* Visit 5 Interim (Month 6)
* Visit 6 Interim (Month 9)
* Visit 7 End of Treatment (Month 12)

Study: Denosumab China Phase III Study

Summary: This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab 60 milligrams (mg) for 12 month treatment in Chinese postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at increased risk of fracture.

Detailed Description: The aim of this Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab (DMAb) in Chinese postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at increased risk of fracture. The study design consists of two phases: Screening and 12-month Double-Blind treatment phase. Following the Screening phase, all eligible subjects will be randomized to receive Double-Blind DMAb (60 mg) or Placebo study medication in a 3:1 ratio. DMAb 60 mg and placebo will be administered as a single subcutaneous (SC) injection at the beginning of the Double-Blind phase and at 6 months following the initial dose. All subjects will receive daily supplementation of oral elemental calcium (at least 600 mg) and vitamin D (at least 400 International Units \[IU\]). The primary objective is to determine the effects of DMAb compared to placebo with respect to mean percent change in BMD at the lumbar spine, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), from Baseline to Month 12. Secondary objectives include the evaluation between the DMAb and placebo treatment groups: change in BMD: at the lumbar spine (Month 6), total hip (Months 6 and 12), femoral neck (Months 6 and 12) and trochanter (Months 6 and 12); and serum biomarkers of bone formation and resorption (Months 6 and 12). Clinical safety of denosumab will also be assessed in this population.

Study: Perimenopausal Effects of Estradiol on Reward Responsiveness

Summary: Using neuroimaging, the investigator will study the effects of estrogen on mood and brain function in perimenopausal women either with or without depression.

Detailed Description: Despite decades of research, affective disorders are prevalent and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Unraveling the pathophysiology of affective disorders has been uniquely challenging because depressive syndromes are heterogeneous and have diverse etiologies. Thus, past studies aimed at identifying neural and genetic biomarkers that would improve the prediction of susceptibility, course of illness, and treatment response have yielded inconsistent results. The investigator proposes to address this problem by studying perimenopausal major depressive disorder (MDD), a depression subtype with a specific endocrine trigger (i.e., ovarian hormone withdrawal). Evidence supporting ovarian hormone withdrawal as a trigger for affective dysfunction in perimenopausal MDD includes the following: perimenopausal women show a temporal association between ovarian hormone withdrawal and the onset of mood symptoms; treatment with estrogen reduces mood symptoms; and blinded estradiol withdrawal re-precipitates depression in women with a history of perimenopausal MDD (manuscript in preparation). Focusing on perimenopausal MDD, a more homogeneous subtype with a specific endocrine trigger, will increase the likelihood of identifying meaningful neurobiological markers.One of the most powerful tools for understanding the neural mediators of MDD is brain imaging. Prior research suggests that the frontostriatal reward system is regulated by estradiol and implicated in MDD. However, neural mechanisms of perimenopausal MDD have never been studied. We will assess the neural reward system in perimenopausal women with and without MDD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and following estradiol treatment. The central hypothesis is that the neural reward system is hypoactive in perimenopausal MDD, and the antidepressant effects of a three-week transdermal estradiol intervention will be mediated by increased activity in the neural reward system, assessed using fMRI. The investigator will test the hypothesis by executing the following aims:

Aim 1: To measure the frontostriatal response to reward in perimenopausal MDD and test the effects of estradiol on neural activation in perimenopausal women. The investigator will use fMRI at baseline and following estradiol treatment in women with and without MDD to probe frontostriatal reward circuitry.

Aim 2: To quantify motivated behavior at baseline and following estradiol administration in perimenopausal women with and without MDD. Motivated behavior will be operationally defined as the response latency to reward versus non-reward during the fMRI reward task.

Aim 3: To measure the psychological correlates of the frontostriatal response to reward in women with perimenopausal MDD at baseline and following estradiol administration. Depressive symptoms will be assessed at baseline and following estradiol administration.

The results will provide critical information about the neuroendocrine pathophysiology of perimenopausal depression and may subsequently contribute to the development of novel pharmacologic interventions.

Results: Outcome: Caudate Signal Intensity in Response to Reward During the MID fMRI Task Following Estradiol Treatment.. Time frame: Post-treatment (visit 6). Description: Caudate reactivity to reward during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task was measured between the two groups. During MID the task, participants respond to "win" trials by pressing a button on a button box in the MRI as quickly as possible when the see a target. Reactivity is measured by examining participant's change in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) (i.e., measurement of oxygen level that is carried to neurons by red blood cells since areas of the brain that are thought to be more "active" or involved in certain tasks require more oxygen) in response to a stimulus of interest (win trials) versus non-stimulus (non-win trials).

As such, the range of possible scores is 10 to 50. The Dysphoria scale includes items assessing feelings of depression, inadequacy, psychomotor agitation, guilt, discouragement, anhedonia, poor concentration, difficulty with decision-making, psychomotor retardation, and worry.

Study: TXV13-01 Estradiol Vaginal Softgel Capsules in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Symptoms of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy

Summary: The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TX-12-004-HR 10 μg in treating moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy associated with menopause after 14 days of treatment, and to estimate the effect size and variability of vulvovaginal atrophy endpoints. In addition, the systemic exposure to estradiol from single and multiple doses of TX-12-004-HR was to be investigated.

Detailed Description: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of the TX-12-004-HR formulation in reducing moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy associated with menopause and to investigate the systemic exposure to estradiol following once daily intravaginal administrations of TX-12-004-HR for 14 days.

Postmenopausal subjects who met the study entry criteria were randomized to one of two treatment groups (TX-12-004-HR or Placebo). During the Screening period subjects were asked to self-assess the symptoms of vulvar and/or vaginal atrophy, including vaginal dryness, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, dysuria, vaginal pain associated with sexual activity and vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity. Subjects with at least one self-assessed moderate to severe symptom of vulvar and/or vaginal atrophy identified by the subject as being most bothersome to her were eligible to participate in the study.

Study: The Vaginal Health Trial

Summary: This is a new application from the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) Clinical Trials network. Here we propose to conduct a large multicenter trial comparing two common treatments, a vaginal hormone tablet and an over-the-counter gel, with placebo to evaluate their effects on bothersome vaginal symptoms and sexual function, and to create a biorepository of specimens for future translational, mechanistic research on the etiology of vaginal symptoms.

Detailed Description: The Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) Clinical Trials network was established in 2009. By the end of 2014, the network completed 4 clinical trials testing 7 interventions in approximately 1000 women ages 40-62 with vasomotor (VMS) and other menopause symptoms.

The current trial will evaluate a relatively understudied area of menopause - vaginal health and sexual function. This is a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial among postmenopausal women ages 45-70.

Our primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of ultra-low dose vaginal estradiol (Vagifem 10 mcg), non-hormonal hydrophilic non-prescriptive vaginal gel (Replens) and placebo in reducing the Most Bothersome Symptom (MBS) severity. Choices for MBS include vulvovaginal itching, pain, dryness, irritation, or pain with penetration.

Secondary aims include an evaluation of a composite score of vaginal symptoms, sexual function, treatment satisfaction, menopause quality of life, and objective measures of genitourinary atrophy. We will also create a biorepository of vaginal and blood specimens. In a subset of women, we will examine whether treatment response is related to: a) the post-menopausal vaginal microbiome; b) vaginal mucosal inflammation; and c) reproductive hormone profiles. The in-depth focus on the mechanisms associated with postmenopausal vaginal symptoms will use state of the art microbiologic techniques on longitudinally collected biologic specimens and will guide future translational studies.

Study: Zoledronic Acid for Osteoporotic Fracture Prevention (ZEST II)

Summary: The goal of this study is to perform the first fracture reduction clinical trial with a potent antiresorptive agent (intravenous zoledronic acid) in the most vulnerable long-term care population.

Detailed Description: Although close to 85% of frail women in long-term care (LTC) facilities have osteoporosis and the risk of osteoporotic fractures is nearly 10 times that of community dwelling elderly, few are treated and studies are scarce. It is postulated that in frail, LTC women an annual infusion of zoledronic acid, an antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis, will:

1. be effective demonstrated by fracture reduction;
2. be safe.

To address these hypotheses, up to 1000 female LTC residents age 65 and older will be screened in order to enroll 310 eligible for randomization in a 3 year, randomized, double-blind, calcium and vitamin D controlled trial with the antiresorptive agent zoledronic acid. Use of an intravenous, once yearly agent avoids concerns of oral bisphosphonate side effects, poor absorption and burden on staff. Participants will reside in the long-term care settings associated with the Division of Geriatric Medicine, University of Pittsburgh and will include women with multiple comorbid conditions, functional and cognitive impairment, and limited mobility.

Results: Outcome: Non-traumatic Incidental Fractures (Vertebral and Nonvertebral [Identified by X-ray, CT, MRI, VFA Imaging] Per Person-year). Time frame: 3 years. Description: Number of fractures divided by number of person-years. Effectiveness of fracture reduction will be demonstrated by total non-traumatic incidental fractures (vertebral and nonvertebral \[identified by x-ray, CT, MRI, VFA imaging) except those viewed as severe trauma (fall from a height higher than a stool or chair or severe trauma other than a fall), cancer-related or fractures of the toes, finger or facial bones.. Parameters: Incident Rate Ratio = 1.05 (p = 0.7251, CI 0.9-1.22). Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY.
Study: A Study of Ibandronate (Boniva) to Evaluate Bone Turnover Markers in Women With Treatment-Naive Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

Summary: This study will evaluate whether an early positive response to once-monthly oral ibandronate in treatment-naive participants with postmenopausal osteoporosis is predictive of efficacy later in treatment. The anticipated time on study treatment is 6 months, and the target sample size is 360 individuals.

Detailed Description: NA

Results: Outcome: Percentage of Participants Who Were "Very Confident" or "Confident" to Items on the Boniva Confidence Scale (BCS) at Month 6. Time frame: Month 6. Description: The BCS is designed to measure the participant's confidence level that Boniva (ibandronate) therapy is effective in treating osteoporosis and reducing the risk of fracture. Response options ranged on a 5-point scale from 'Not At All Confident' to 'Very Confident.' A Boniva confidence responder was defined as a participant who reported a response of 'confident' or 'very confident' on the 2 items in BCS. (1) ibandronate was effective in treating osteoporosis and (2) ibandronate reduces the risk of breaking a bone.. Parameters: Difference in percentage of participants = 16.9 (p = 0.002, CI 6.1-27.7); Difference in percentage of participants = 14.9 (p = 0.009, CI 4-25.8); Difference in percentage of participants = 16.9 (p = 0.001, CI 6.3-27.5); Difference in percentage of participants = 14.9 (p = 0.01, CI 3.9-25.9).

Study: Ribociclib and Letrozole in Treating Patients With Relapsed ER Positive Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Primary Peritoneal, or Endometrial Cancer

Summary: This phase II trial studies how well ribociclib and letrozole work in treating patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, or endometrial cancer that has returned (come back) after a period of improvement. Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some enzymes needed for cell growth. Cancer cells that are estrogen receptor positive may need estrogen to grow. Letrozole lowers the amount of estrogen made by the body and this may stop the growth of tumor cells that need estrogen to grow. Giving ribociclib together with letrozole may be an effective treatment in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, or endometrial cancer.

Detailed Description: PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Demonstrate if the combination of letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) leads to a higher percentage of patients who are progression free at 12 weeks (PFS 12) as compared with that observed in prior studies with single agent letrozole.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Demonstrate if the combination of letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) leads to a higher cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) response rate in patients with relapsed ER positive ovarian cancers and endometrial cancers as compared to that observed in previously reported single agent letrozole studies.

II. Median progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), the confirmed response rate, and adverse events.

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Identify molecular biomarkers associated with a response to treatment with letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) (in patients with relapsed ovarian carcinomas and endometrial cancers).

II. Develop patient derived xenograft (PDX) avatars on tumors from participants for possible future translational study evaluating a potential correlation between responses in the PDX model to patients' responses.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) daily and letrozole PO daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years.

Seventy patients with postmenopausal bleeding will be included in the study after verbal consent. They will be recruited from patients attending gynecologic clinic in Banha University hospital.

All patients will be subjected to the following:

For all included women the following will be done:

1. Full history taking.
2. Complete general, abdominal, and local examination.
3. Ultrasonographic assessment of the uterus

All data were performed for all patients in the lithotomy position after they had emptied their bladder using a 7.5 megahertz transducer by a single operator.

1. Using colour Doppler in the 2D mode, flow velocity waveforms were obtained from the ascending main branch of the uterine artery on the right and left side of the cervix in a longitudinal plane before they entered the uterus.
2. The gate of the Doppler was positioned when the vessel with good colour signals was identified on the screen. Pulsatility index of the uterine arteries were calculated electronically when similar consecutive waveforms of good quality were obtained and the averaged uterine PI.

   Pulsatility index (PI):

   This index, also known as the mean pulsatility index, to distinguish it from the peak to peak pulsatility index, is expressed by: PI= (S-D) / Mean Where S is the peak systolic velocity, D is the end diastolic velocity and velocity is the time averaged maximum velocity over the cardiac cycle (1).
3. Blood flow velocity waveforms were evaluated in the spiral arteries at the sub endometrial region that is within 1 mm of the originally defined myometrial-endometrial contour (2).

Histopathological diagnosis of endometrium obtained by biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis.

Study: Brown Adipose Tissue Activity in Pre- and Postmenopausal Women

Summary: The physiological relevance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans is largely unknown. The investigators have shown that suppressing ovarian function in premenopausal women reduces resting energy expenditure (REE), and this is prevented by adding back estradiol (E2). The investigators preliminary data suggest that this may be due, in part, to reduced brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity. The overarching hypothesis is that BAT activity in humans is modulated by E2. To determine if natural declines in endogenous E2 contribute to changes in BAT activity, we will compare BAT activity in pre-and post-menopausal women. The investigators will also explore whether suppression of ovarian hormones in pre-menopausal women impairs BAT activity. BAT activity will be quantified using dynamic positron emission topography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging combined with 11C-acetate tracers. We will assess the thermogenic response of BAT by measuring cold-induced changes in REE, shivering, and skin and core temperature.

Detailed Description: Participants will be asked to perform studies to measure resting metabolic rate and activity of brown adipose tissue or brown fat. Brown fat is different from regular "white fat" in that it produces heat and burns calories. The investigators will measure how active brown fat is at normal room temperature and after participants have been exposed to cold.

The study will last 5-6 hours. It will consist of measurements made in warm temperatures and then after a period of cold exposure. For the cold exposure part of the study, participants will be asked to wear a cooling suit for 3 hrs. Skin temperature is normally about 90º Fahrenheit. The cooling suit will adjust the water temperature until your skin temperature is about 82º Fahrenheit. The suit will cover the entire body except for the face, hands, and feet. Participants may feel cold while wearing the suit and you may shiver some, but based on past studies, any shivering should be minor.

Before and after the cooling suit is turned on, body scans will be performed using a procedure called positron emission tomography (PET). These scans do not use radiation. Before the PET scans, the investigators will infuse radioactive tracer into an arm. These tracers have a low dose of radiation and will show us where the brown fat is and how active it is. One PET scan will be performed at room temperature, and the second scan will be performed after the cooling suit has been worn for 3 hours. Two additional scans using computed tomography (CT) will be performed at end of the study. CT scans are like an x-ray, and use radiation. The radiation dose in the CT scan is much higher than the tracers. When the CT scans are combined with the PET scans, we can separate brown fat from white fat.

15 pre-menopausal women will be asked to volunteer for a follow up study. For 5 months, pre-menopausal women in this study will receive monthly injections that contain a study drug (leuprolide) that reduces estrogen to postmenopausal levels. This drug is approved by the FDA to reduce estrogen for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, but is not approved for use in healthy women. In this study, the drug is being used to decrease hormones to determine if this reduces brown fat activity. 6 months after the first injection, these women will be asked to repeat the PET/CT studies.

Results: Outcome: Brown Adipose Tissue Activity -Warm Exposure. Time frame: 5-6 hrs. Description: Brown adipose tissue activity in warm temperatures will be measured using the radioactive tracer 11C-acetate. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 1e-04, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: OTHER.

Study: Menopausal Sleep Fragmentation and Body Fat Gain

Summary: This study aims to investigate the impact of menopause-related sleep fragmentation on metabolic biomarkers of body fat gain. The investigators hypothesize that experimental sleep fragmentation will result in an adverse leptin response as a metabolic biomarker for body fat gain.

Detailed Description: While obesity is highly prevalent in midlife and older women, with rates increasing markedly after age 40 and body fat increasing in half of women during and after the menopause transition, factors causing these changes are not well understood. Reduced total sleep time has been shown to adversely impact biomarkers of obesity, but the effect of the highly prevalent menopause-related sleep fragmentation secondary to hot flashes on metabolism and eating behaviors in humans is not known. We will use experimental paradigms to isolate the impact of menopause-related sleep disruption, as well as that of hot flashes and estrogen withdrawal, metabolic biomarkers of body fat gain and on eating behaviors, results of which will inform strategies to prevent body fat gain and improve cardio-metabolic health outcomes in women.

Results: Outcome: Normalized Satiety Scores. Time frame: pre/post sleep fragmentation (3 days); pre/post estradiol withdrawal (~5 weeks).

Study: A Dose-ranging Study of the Efficacy of ESN364 in Postmenopausal Women Suffering Vasomotor Symptoms (Hot Flashes)

Summary: This study determined the effects of different doses and dosing regimens of ESN364 on the frequency and severity of hot flashes. The treatment was administered for 12 weeks to postmenopausal women, aged 40 to 65, suffering at least 50 moderate to severe hot flashes per week.

Detailed Description: This was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel-group, multi-center study to assess the efficacy of ESN364 in postmenopausal women suffering from vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes).

This study consisted of a screening period (Days -35 to -1, including the screening visit \[Visit 1\] and a minimum 7-day collection of baseline vasomotor symptom frequency and severity assessments), a 12 week treatment period (Day 1 \[Visit 2\] to Week 12 \[Visit 5\]), and a follow up visit (Week 15 \[Visit 6\]) 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

The study was performed on an ambulatory basis. The screening visit (Visit 1) occurred up to 35 days prior to randomization. Eligibility was assessed via physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs, ECG, Pap smear, mammography, and endometrial biopsy. Subjects received an electronic diary to record daily vasomotor symptoms during the duration of the screening period. Subjects who had ≥7 consecutive days of vasomotor symptom recordings participated in the study. Subjects are encouraged to continue recording for the duration of the whole screening period. The electronic diary was reviewed by study site staff on Day 1 (Visit 2) to confirm study eligibility. Subjects were rescreened 1 time upon approval of the medical monitor.

During the treatment period, subjects returned to the study site every 4 weeks for assessments.

The follow-up visit occurred approximately 3 weeks following the last dose of study drug.

Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY. Outcome: Change From Baseline in Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15. Time frame: Baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15. Description: The HFRDIS is a 10-item scale that measures a woman's perceptions of the degree to which VMS interfere with 9 daily life activities (work, social activities, leisure, sleep, mood, concentration, relations with others, sexuality, and enjoying life); the tenth item measures interference with overall quality of life. This scale was modeled after items on the Brief Pain Inventory and Brief Fatigue Inventory, which assess the extent to which pain or fatigue interfere with daily life. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which VMS had interfered with each item during the previous 2-week time interval using a 0 (do not interfere) to 10 (completely interfere) scale. Overall mean score is the average of individual item scores (sum of items/10)..

Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY. Outcome: Change From Baseline in Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQoL) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15. Time frame: Baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15. Description: The MENQoL is self-administered and consists of a total of 29 items in a Likert-scale format. Each item assesses the impact of 1 of 4 domains of menopausal symptoms, as experienced over the last month: vasomotor (items 1 to 3), psychosocial (items 4 to 10), physical (items 11 to 26), and sexual (items 27 to 29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not present, and if present, how bothersome on a 0 (not bothersome) to 6 (extremely bothersome) scale. Means are computed for each subscale by dividing the sum of the domain's items by the number of items within that domain. Non-endorsement of an item is scored a "1" and endorsement a "2," plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible score on any item ranges from 1 to 8. Higher scores indicate that menopause symptoms are more bothersome..

Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY. Outcome: Change From Baseline in The Hot Flash Score of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS to Each Study Week. Time frame: Baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Description: The hot flash score per 24h (or 12 h day time or 12 h night time) of VMS (mild, moderate, and severe) is calculated as follows:

(number of mild VMS x 1) + (number of moderate VMS x 2) + (number of severe VMS x 3).

Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant did not wake up but later noticed damp sheets or clothing.

Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed). Higher score indicates greater severity..

Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY. Outcome: Change From Baseline in The Mean Frequency of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS to Each Study Week. Time frame: Baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Description: The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, subject does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed)..

Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY. Outcome: Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) Domain Scores at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 15. Time frame: Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15. Description: The LSEQ is a 10-item self-rated questionnaire that assesses a participants aspects of sleep and early morning behavior. The questions are grouped into 4 chronological areas: ease of getting to sleep, perceived quality of sleep, ease of awaking from sleep, and integrity of early morning behavior following wakefulness. The LSEQ is a visual analog scale that requires respondents to place marks on a group of 10 cm lines. Lines extend between extremes like "more difficult than usual" and "easier than usual." Responses are measured using a 100 mm scale and are averaged to a score for each domain. Higher scores indicates better sleep and better early morning behavior..

Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY. Outcome: Mean Percent Reduction of Mild, Moderate, And Severe Vasomotor Symptoms From Baseline to Each Study Week. Time frame: Baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Description: The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, subject does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed)..

A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed)..

Time frame: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Description: The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed)..

Time frame: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Description: The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed)..

Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY. Outcome: Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 100% in The Mean Frequency of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS From Baseline to Each Study Week. Time frame: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Description: The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed)..

Time frame: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Description: The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed)..

Non-inferiority type: SUPERIORITY. Outcome: Number of Participants With Mean Percent Reduction of 90% in The Mean Frequency of Mild, Moderate, and Severe VMS From Baseline to Each Study Week. Time frame: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Description: The frequency of mild, moderate and severe VMS was the number of mild, moderate and severe VMS per 24 hours. A daily frequency and severity per week was derived by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. Mild VMS was defined as sensation of heat without sweating/dampness. If at night, participant does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. Moderate VMS was defined as sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but was able to continue activity. If at night, participant woke up because she was feeling hot and/or was sweating, but no action was necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. Severe VMS was defined as sensation of intense heat with sweating, caused disruption of activity. If at night, participant woke up hot and was sweating and needed to take action (e.g., remove layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed)..

Study: A Study of the Safety and Effect of Repeated Administration of G-CSF on Hot Flashes in Postmenopausal Women

Summary: The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of repeated administration of G-CSF for the treatment of hot flashes and vasomotor symptoms in women with naturally-occurring or surgically induced menopause. G-CSF will be administered three times at 28 day intervals to postmenopausal women, ages 40 to 65, suffering at least 49 moderate to severe hot flashes per week.

Detailed Description: This is a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Eligible subjects will be stratified by natural or surgical menopause and randomized (1:1) to receive 3 single injections, 28-days apart, of either G-CSF or placebo.

This study will consist of a 14-21 day screening period. Subjects enrolled will be given three single 1.0 mL subcutaneous (SC) injections (repeated 28-days apart), in the outer area of either upper arm, of either G-CSF or placebo (sterile physiological saline) at Baseline, Day 28 and Day 56. Subjects will be followed for 12 weeks and will complete hot flash diary entries every day for the duration of treatment. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry and complete blood count with differential) and vital signs. A follow-up phone call will occur 60 days after the last dose of study drug.

Eligibility will be assessed via physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs.

Subjects will receive a diary in which to record daily hot flashes symptoms during the duration of the screening period. Subjects must have at least 14 days of hot flash recordings to participate in the study. The diary will be reviewed by study site staff on Baseline (Day 0) to confirm study eligibility.

During the treatment period, subjects will return to the study site at Days 1, 21, 28, 29, 49, 56, 57, and 84 for assessments.

The follow-up phone call will occur approximately 60 days following the last dose of study drug.

Study: Early Effects of Abaloparatide on Tissue-Based Indices of Bone Formation and Resorption

Summary: The objective of this study is to measure the early effects of abaloparatide on tissue-based bone formation using samples obtained by transiliac crest bone biopsy after quadruple fluorochrome labeling.

Detailed Description: This was an open-label, single-arm study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated with 80 micrograms (μg) abaloparatide for 3 months. Transiliac bone biopsies were taken at 3 months after quadruple fluorochrome labeling. The treatment duration of 3 months was determined to be the optimal time when biochemical markers of bone turnover peak and are predictive of subsequent changes in bone mineral density (BMD).

The main study was conducted for a 3-month treatment period with a 1-month follow up. A sub-study was conducted at 1 site to collect peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) data. Study treatment for participants in the sub-study was extended for an additional 3 months of study drug administration for a total of 6 months of treatment.

Results: Outcome: Change From Baseline in Mineralizing Surface/Bone Surface (MS/BS) in the Cancellous Envelope at Month 3. Time frame: Baseline (Day 1), Month 3. Description: Change in dynamic histomorphometry indices was assessed in the cancellous envelope.. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 1e-04, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: OTHER.
Study: Effects of a Tissue Selective Estrogen Complex (TSEC) on Depression and the Neural Reward System in the Perimenopause"

Summary: Using neuroimaging, the investigator will study the effects of estrogen on mood and brain function in perimenopausal women with depression.

Detailed Description: Despite decades of clinical research, depression continues to affect 20.9 million Americans each year and remains the leading cause of disability worldwide. Women are twice as likely as men to experience depression, and depression symptoms are particularly common during periods of hormone change. Depression risk increases 14-fold in the two years surrounding menopause, suggesting that hormone changes may cause depression during this time. Past research has shown that estrogen, in particular, plays an important role in depression during the transition to menopause ("the perimenopause") for the following reasons: 1) depression begins when estrogen levels plummet, 2) estrogen therapy reduces depression symptoms, and 3) when perimenopausal women who were treated with estrogen are taken off of estrogen (without their knowledge), their depression returns. Despite clear evidence that estrogen plays a role in depression during the perimenopause (DPM), the investigators don't know how estrogen affects the brain, which is important for developing effective medications to treat DPM and also for determining which patients are most likely to benefit from medication that replaces the estrogen lost during menopause (estrogen replacement therapy).

The investigator received a grant from the National Institutes of Health, which received preliminary support from the Foundation of Hope, to characterize the effect of estrogen replacement therapy on the brain in women with DPM and women without depression ("controls"). The brain pathway affected most by depression is the neural reward circuit, which consists of a number of different brain regions that act in concert to determine a person's response to rewards. Activity in the neural reward circuit depends on estrogen levels and is reduced in people with depression. The investigator's NIH-funded study will be the first to examine how the neural reward circuit is affected by DPM and estrogen replacement therapy. While estrogen replacement therapy acts as an antidepressant, many women elect not to take estrogen and many physicians discourage its use because of the risk of long-term negative health effects, including breast and uterine cancer. A new FDA-approved compound, Duavee, combines estrogen with another medication, bazedoxifene, which protects against breast and uterine cancer while reducing hot flashes. Duavee may therefore be more acceptable to women with DPM and their doctors than estrogen replacement therapy. However, the effects of Duavee on depression and the neural reward circuit have never been tested, and one can't infer that estrogen will have the same antidepressant effects in the presence of bazedoxifene (which partially blocks the effects of estrogen in certain tissues).

The purpose of the proposed project is to 1) test the antidepressant effects of Duavee, and 2) quantify the effects of Duavee on the neural reward circuit. The investigators expect that Duavee will reduce symptoms of depression and increase activity in the neural reward circuit. In this study, the investigators will recruit medically healthy, unmedicated women with DPM and administer Duavee for 3 weeks (a duration that has been shown in previous studies of estrogen replacement to be sufficient for treating depression). Eligibility will be assessed by an initial telephone screen and confirmed by a gynecologic exam, laboratory testing, and an interview about their current and past depression symptoms. Only women with depression that began during the menopause transition (i.e., when they started skipping periods) will be enrolled. Both before and after treatment, women will have a fMRI brain scan to determine the effects of the medication on the neural reward circuit. During the 3-week treatment, women will come into the clinic to have their blood drawn, refill their medication, and answer questions about their mood and menopause symptoms.This study is important because untreated DPM contributes to cardiac deaths. Many women are afraid to use estrogen replacement therapy because of the long-term risk of cancer and yet refuse to take antidepressants for fear of side effects and stigma. Because Duavee addresses the main potential problems of estrogen replacement therapy, this research stands to revolutionize treatment for DPM. The use of estrogen replacement therapy to treat DPM is a relatively new area of research and one of great importance given the large and increasing number of women who enter the perimenopause each year and are potentially at risk for depression. Women with DPM seek treatment from gynecologists, psychiatrists, and general practitioners, yet there is neither consensus nor practical guidelines for preventing and treating DPM.

Specific Aims: The investigators currently are assessing the neural reward system in subjects with perimenopausal major depressive disorder (PM-MDD) and those without depression ("controls") using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and following estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). The Foundation of Hope (FOH) award will allow us to add a Tissue Selective Estrogen Complex (TSEC) treatment condition in a separate group of PM-MDD. The investigators' central hypothesis is that the neural reward system is hypoactive in PM-MDD, and the antidepressant effects of a three-week TSEC intervention will be associated with increased activity in the neural reward system, assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The investigators will test the hypothesis by executing the following aims: Aim 1: Determine the extent to which TSEC reduces anhedonia and other depressive symptoms in PM-MDD. Anhedonia and other depressive symptoms will be assessed at baseline and following TSEC administration. The investigators also will compare the effects of TSEC and ERT in PM-MDD. Hypothesis 1: Women PM-MDD will report a significant reduction in depressive symptoms following TSEC administration, and the degree of symptom improvement will be associated with the change in frontostriatal responsivity to reward. Aim 2: Quantify the effect of TSEC on the neural reward system in PM-MDD. The investigators will use fMRI at baseline and following TSEC treatment in PM-MDD to probe frontostriatal reward circuitry. The investigator will also compare the effects of TSEC and ERT in PM-MDD. Hypothesis 2: PM-MDD will show increased activation of the frontostriatal circuit in response to reward following TSEC administration (compared with baseline).

Results: Outcome: Change in Frontostriatal Reactivity to Reward During MID fMRI Task. Time frame: Baseline to 3 weeks. Description: The primary outcome measure is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected during a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task. All participants will complete the fMRI Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task at baseline and at 3 weeks. During the task, participants need to select the correct response during "win" and "lose" conditions by pressing a button on a button box in the MRI. Participant's blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activation response (A measurement of oxygen level that is released to neurons since areas of the brain that are thought to be more "active" or involved in certain tasks require more oxygen to perform the tasks.) is measured while they performed the task in MRI scanner.. Parameters: NA = NA (p = 0.53, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: NON_INFERIORITY. Outcome: Depressive Symptoms as Measured by the MASQ-AD. Time frame: Baseline, week 2, week 3, week 4 (post treatment). Description: The second primary outcome measure uses the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire - Anhedonic Depression Scale (MASQ-AD) to examine symptom change. All participants will complete the MASQ-AD at each study visit, which measures their current symptoms of depression and anxiety. Scores range from 22 to 110 with lower scores reflecting a better outcome.. Parameters: GLM = -5.8 (p = 0.001, CI NA-NA). Non-inferiority type: NON_INFERIORITY.
Study: The Effect of a Multivitamin in the Treatment of Memory Loss in Postmenopausal Women

Summary: Complaints about memory loss are very common in women in the menopausal transition period. The effectiveness of estrogen replacement therapy in cognitive improvement is controversial. Partial positive results were obtained in some studies with regard to memory improvement, so far no standard treatment considered effective in these cases. Effective pharmacological approaches to the treatment of memory loss associated with menopause are an unmet medical need. Cogmax® is a multivitamin and mineral supplement that contains numerous key elements for cognitive function, and may be a safe therapeutic option in these cases.

The multicenter, non-comparative (single-arm) phase IV clinical trial will be conducted with 80 female participants aged 45 to 60 years and menopausal memory loss complaint.

After 3 months of using multivitamin and mineral supplement, memory and attention will be reevaluated through specific questionnaire and the Stroop Test Victoria version.

Detailed Description: This multicenter, non-comparative phase IV clinical trial will be conducted at brazilian clinical trial centers under the auspices of Eurofarma Laboratories S.A. Recruitment for the study will begin after the relevant ethical and regulatory approvals and will have an estimated duration of 4 months.

The study will include 80 female participants aged between 45 and 60 years and menopausal memory complaints who consent to participate in the study by signing the informed consent form.

To be included, participants must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Each participant will initially complete a selection period with a maximum duration of 14 days for evaluation of eligibility. Participants will then be treated with Cogmax® in the dosage of two capsules per day for 12 weeks.

Study: Serum Levels of C Type Natriuretic Peptide in Different Reproductive Periods

Summary: Recent studies have shown that C natriuretic peptide (CNP) is produced from granulosa cells, increasing cumulative guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production by affecting cumulus cells through natriuretic peptide receptors.It has been suggested that the transport of cGMP to oocyte via gap junctions causes a continuous increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels within the oocyte. An important role of increased cAMP levels in oocyte is shown to suppress meiotic progression. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) studies in animals have shown that expression of the natriuretic peptide precursor increases during the periovulatory period and shows that this increase decreases rapidly after Luteinizing hormone(LH) / human chorionic(hCG) stimulation. Human studies have shown that after ovulation induction, the CNP level in follicular fluid decreases following ovulatory dose of hCG (9).

Detailed Description: In this prospective study, 60 patients are planned to recruite. Group 1 consists of 20 healthy reproductive aged women between 18-40 years old, with regular menstruation. Group 2 will include 20 patients in perimenopausal time period between 40-49 ages and in group 3 there will be20 postmenopausal women.

Age, gravida, parity and body mass index (BMI) data of all patients will be recorded. BMI is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters. All patients will go under ultrasound examination by the same clinician (ACO). The number of antral follicles in group 1 and group 2 will be recorded. In addition, on the 2nd or 3rd day of menstruation, serum FSH, LH and E2 data of the patients in group 1 and 2 will be recorded.

For the last 6 months, patients with drug use that may affect menstruation like oral contraceptives, patients with cardiac or renal disease and therefore drug use, causes of infertility other than unexplained infertility, history of ovarian surgery, presence of polycystic ovary syndrome, and patients with irregular menstruation will be excluded for the study. In addition, patients with renal, cardiac, central nervous system and endocrine diseases will be excluded.

Morning fasting venous blood samples will be taken from the patients on the 2nd or 3rd day of the menstruation for group 1 and 2. All blood samples will be centrifuged on the day of collection and separated serum samples and will be kept at -80 degrees until the day of CNP test. Serum CNP levels of the patients will be analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay for human CNP in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (SEA721Hu, ELISA Kit for Human CNP, Wuhan USCN Business Co., Ltd., Cloud-Clone Corp., CCC, USA).

Data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS v15, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The variables will be investigated using visual and analytical methods (histograms, homogeneity of variances test, Kolmogorov-Simirnov/Shapiro-Wilk's test) to determine whether or not they are normally distributed. Patient demographics and CNP values will be presented as median ± interquartile range. Gravida and parity will be demonstrated by frequency distribution. The correlation coefficients and their significance will be calculated using the Spearman test. P-values less than 0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant.

Study: Alterations of GCF Levels of Sclerostin and DKK-1 in Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

Summary: Symptoms of periodontal disease are tissue destruction and destruction of the alveolar bone which supports the tooth. Wnt way (wingless-type MMTV integration site family) plays a role in the regulation of bone homeostasis in periodontal disease-induced bone resorption. The Wnt / β-catenin signal is controlled by physiological antagonists, including dickkopf released from osteocytes-associated protein 1 (DKK-1) and sclerostin (SOST). Thus, Wnt inhibitors SOST and DKK-1 affect bone mass changes. Bisphosphonates used in osteoporous treatment are selective inhibitors of bone resorption. In the serum of postmenopausal osteoporotic women treated with bisphosphonate, short-term and decreased DKK-1 level during the treatment, and increased SOST in the late period were reported. Increased bone formation after bisphosphonate treatment in postmenopausal osteoporotic patients has been associated with increased serum SOST level. The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate in patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis on the bone demolition metabolism in periodontally healthy and periodontally diseased tooth regions and gingival health with the clinical data by investigating the SOST and DDK-1 molecules that play role in bone destruction mechanism.

Detailed Description: This study aims to reveal the effect of initial periodontal treatment together with bisphosphonate on sclerostin (SOST) and dickkopf-related protein-1 (DKK-1) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of patients with osteoporosis.

Clinical recordings and GCF were obtained from postmenopausal women; with chronic periodontitis and those using bisphosphonate (Group A, n=12), with chronic periodontitis and otherwise healthy (Group B, n=10), without chronic periodontitis and those using bisphosphonate (Group C, n=11), systemically and periodontally healthy controls (Group D, n=10) at the baseline.

Study: Comparative Efficacy and Safety Study of RGB-14-P and Prolia® in Women With Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

Summary: This study will be conducted to assess the efficacy, pharmacodynamic (PD), safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of RGB -14- P compared to US-licensed Prolia® in participants with postmenopausal osteoporosis, in a comparative manner.

Detailed Description: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, multiple fixed-dose, 2-arm parallel-group study that includes 2 periods as:

1. Main period (52 weeks), consists of Treatment Period 1 (26 weeks) and Treatment Period 2 (26 weeks). On Day 1 of Treatment Period 1, prior to dosing, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either RGB-14-P or Prolia®.
2. Transition Period: consists of Treatment Period 3 (26 weeks). On Day 1 of Treatment Period 3 (Week 52), a subset of participants who received Prolia® during the Main Period will be re-randomized 1:1 to receive either a dose RGB-14-P or Prolia® in a double-blinded manner. A subset of participants continuing in the Transition Period who received RGB-14-P during the Main Period will continue to receive a dose of RGB-14- P but will also follow the randomization procedure to maintain blinding.

All participants will receive the study drugs on 2 occasions (Weeks 0 and 26), on Day 1 of Treatment Periods 1 and 2. Participants continuing to the Transition Period will receive the study drugs on a third-occasion (Week 52), Day 1 of Treatment Period 3. One Treatment Period will take 6 months (26 weeks, 183 days).

Study: A Study to Compare Efficacy, PK, PD, Safety and IMM of MB09 to Prolia® [EU-sourced] in Postmenopausal Osteoporosis.

Summary: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, multinational study to compare the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and immunogenicity of MB09 versus Prolia® in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis

Detailed Description: The study was planning to randomise approximately 528 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis aged ≥55 and ≤80 years old with a Bone Mineral Density (BMD) consistent with T-score of ≤ -2.5 and ≥ -4 at the lumbar spine or total hip as measured by DXA during the Screening Period. Screening evaluations were to be completed within 28 days prior to randomisation.

On Day 1, 528 eligible postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were to be randomised in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive MB09-MB09 (Arm 1), Prolia-MB09 (Arm 2), or Prolia-Prolia (Arm 3) using an Interactive Response Sys-tem (IRT).

During the Main Treatment Period, subjects received one subcutaneous injection (60 mg/mL) of study drug on Day 1 and at Month 6. At Month 12, after all efficacy and safety assessments have been performed, the subject were to be enter the Transition/Safety Follow Up Period and were to receive the third dose of study drug. Subjects assigned to the MB09 MB09 arm (Arm 1) received MB09 on Day 1, at Month 6 and at Month 12. Subjects assigned to the Prolia MB09 arm (Arm 2) received EU-Prolia on Day 1 and at Month 6, and MB09 at Month 12. Subjects assigned to the Prolia-Prolia arm (Arm 3) received EU-Prolia on Day 1, at Month 6, and at Month 12. All subjects were to be followed up to Transition Period Month 6.

All subjects received daily supplementation of calcium and vitamin D.

Results: Outcome: Efficacy: Percent Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density (LS-BMD) at Week 52 - Full Analysis Set (FAS). Time frame: Baseline (screening), up to Week 52. Description: Difference in means (MB09-Prolia) in the %CfB in lumbar spine BMD after 12 months in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated with SC denosumab injections every 6 months. This included all subjects and data records irrespective of failed eligibility criteria, receipt of prohibited medications, discontinued treatment for any reason, had errors or deviations in dosing, or receipt of both doses. Estimation was via Multiple Imputation (MI) and ANCOVA on the FAS. Since the retrieved dropout rate was low, a treatment-failure (TF) penalty was applied to the imputed values at Month 12 for those subjects who received only one dose of the study treatment to centre the distribution of each subject's %CfB values around their baseline level. Bone density measurements were performed by DXA. All DXA scans were submitted to a central imaging vendor for analysis.. Parameters: Mean Difference (Final Values) = 0.03 (p = NA, CI -0.69-0.74). Non-inferiority type: EQUIVALENCE. Outcome: Efficacy: Percentage Change From Baseline (%CfB) in Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density (LS-BMD) at 52 Weeks - Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS). Time frame: Baseline (Screening), up to Week 52. Description: To demonstrate equivalent efficacy of MB09 to EU Prolia in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in terms of lumbar spine BMD at Week 52 (Month 12). The main analysis method was on the mFAS using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) fitted to the composite %CfB lumbar spine BMD at Month 6 and Month 12, without any imputation of missing data. Bone mineral density was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and assessments of the lumbar spine (L1 to L4) were performed at a central imaging vendor.. Parameters: Mean Difference (Final Values) = 0.2 (p = NA, CI -0.51-0.91). Non-inferiority type: EQUIVALENCE. Outcome: Pharmacodynamics: %CfB Area Under the Percent Inhibition Curve From Time Zero to 6 Months (AUIC0-6 Months) in sCTX - on mFAS. Time frame: Baseline (pre-dose Day 1), up to Month 6.. Description: AUIC0-6 months = Area under the inhibition curve for % change from baseline sCTX concentrations from time zero to 6 months. Parameters: Ratio of Geometric means = 99.13 (p = NA, CI 96.31-102.02). Non-inferiority type: EQUIVALENCE. Outcome: Pharmacodynamics: Serum Carboxy-terminal Cross-linking Telopeptide of Type I Collagen (sCTX) Area Under the Effect Curve From Zero to 6 Months (AUEC0-6 Months) After First Dose - Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS). Time frame: Baseline (pre-dose Day 1), up to Month 6.. Description: Geometric meant (geometric CV%) sCTX Area under the effect curve from zero to 6 months (AUEC0-6 months) after first dose in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated with SC denosumab injections every 6 months assuming all women received their first denosumab dose without any errors in dosing and without receipt of any prohibited therapies or other osteoporosis medications up to 6 months after first dose.. Parameters: Ratio of Geometric means = 99.91 (p = NA, CI 91.99-108.52). Non-inferiority type: EQUIVALENCE. Outcome: Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Denosumab After First Dose Study Treatment (Pharmacokinetic Parameter Analysis Set). Time frame: Baseline (pre-dose Day 1), up to Month 6. Description: To assess the PK profile of MB09 compared with EU-Prolia following the first dose, maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Denosumab After First Dose study treatment (Pharmacokinetic Parameter Analysis Set).. Parameters: LS Geometric Mean Ratio = 104.13 (p = NA, CI 98.83-109.71). Non-inferiority type: EQUIVALENCE. Outcome: Pharmacokinetics: To Assess the PK Profile of MB09 Compared With EU Prolia (AUC0-6 Months) Following the First Dose. Time frame: Baseline (pre-dose Day 1), up to Month 6.. Description: Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 6 months analysed on the log scale by ANCOVA. The model will include treatment and stratification variables (baseline BMD T-score at the lumbar spine (≤ -3.0 and \> -3.0 SD), body mass index (\< 25 and ≥ 25 kg/m2), age at study entry (≥ 55 to \< 68 years versus ≥ 68 to ≤ 80 years) and prior bisphosphonate medication use at study entry (prior use of bisphosphonates versus no prior bisphosphonate use as fixed effects. The estimated mean difference with 95% CI will be back-transformed to give the ratio of geometric means (MB09/EU-Prolia) with 95% CI following the first dose in the Main Treatment Period.. Parameters: LS Geometric Mean Ratio = 106.06 (p = NA, CI 99.84-112.66). Non-inferiority type: EQUIVALENCE.
